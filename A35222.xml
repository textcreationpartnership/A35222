            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The <hi>New World</hi> is the moſt proper name for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Countrey, and new, as being diſcovered by <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> not two hundred years ago, in 1492. The Ancient Fathers, Philoſophers, and Poets, were of opinion, that thoſe places near the North and South Pole were inhabitable, by the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of cold, and the middle parts, becauſe of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable heat, and thought it a great ſoleciſm or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, to believe the Earth was round, for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which opinion Pope <hi>Zachaus</hi> was ſo zealous againſt Biſhop <hi>Virgil,</hi> that he ſentenced him, <hi>To be caſt out of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57816:4"/>

               <p>Yet is it not incredible but that in former Ages, ſome Ships might by Tempeſt or other Caſualties be driven to theſe parts, whereby ſome parts of <hi>America</hi> were peopled, but it is likely none ever returned back again to bring any news of their voyage. The moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relation of this kind is that of <hi>Madoc ap Owen Gwyneth,</hi> who upon the Civil diſſentions in his own Countrey of <hi>Wales,</hi> adventured to Sea, and leaving <hi>Ireland</hi> on the North, came to a Land unknown, where he ſaw many very wonderful things, which by Dr. <hi>Dowel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Humfrey Lloyd</hi> is judged to be the main Land of <hi>America,</hi> being confirmed therein, as well by the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57816:4"/>
ſaying of <hi>Montezuma</hi> Emperor of <hi>Mexico,</hi> who declared that his Progenitors were Strangers as well as the reſt of the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> as by the uſe of divers <hi>Welch</hi> words amongſt them obſerved by Travellers; the ſtory adds, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi> left ſeveral of his People there, and coming home, returned back with ten ſail full of <hi>Welchmen,</hi> yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there are now left very few footſteps of this <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> expedition, and no ſigns thereof were found at the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Arrival; they indeed uſed a Croſs at <hi>Cumana,</hi> and worſhipped it at <hi>Acuzamil,</hi> but without the leaſt memory or knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and the <hi>Welch</hi> words are very few, which might happen by chance to any other Language. Mr. <hi>Bretewood,</hi> and other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed writers are of Opinion, that <hi>America</hi> received her firſt Inhabitants from thoſe parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> where the <hi>Tartars</hi> firſt inhabited the Coaſts of both Countreys, being in that place not far aſunder, and the likeneſs of the People favouring the ſame, though the <hi>Indians</hi> in general are ſo very ignorant as to aſcribe their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſome to a Fountain, and others to a Lake or Cave; But leaving theſe uncertainties, let us give a brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the real diſcovery thereof by <hi>Columbus,</hi> which is thus related by <hi>Gomara</hi> and <hi>Mariana,</hi> two Spaniſh writers.</p>
               <p>A certain Caravel ſailing in the Ocean, was carried by a ſtrong Eaſt wind of long continuance to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Land never mentioned in the Maps or Charts of that Age; this Ship was much longer in returning than going, ſo that all the company periſht by famine or other extremities, except the Pilot, and three or four Mariners, who all likewiſe died ſoon after their arrival, leaving to <hi>Columbus</hi> their Landlord their Papers, with ſome account of their Diſcoveries; the time, place, Countrey, and name of this Pilot is uncertain, and therefore other Authors affirm it to be a fable or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> contrivance, as envying that an <hi>Italian</hi> and Forreigner ſhould have the glory of being the firſt diſcoverer of the Indies, and the more judicious <hi>Spaniards</hi> account it a Tale, and give a more probable Relation thereof, and of the cauſe which moved <hi>Columbus</hi> to this mighty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57816:5"/>
and not the Pilots Papers or reports; For they write, that <hi>Chriſtopher Colon</hi> or <hi>Columbus,</hi> was born at <hi>Nervi</hi> in the Territories of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and bred a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from his Child-hood, trading into <hi>Syria</hi> and other Eaſtern Countries, after which he learnt the art of making Sea Cards, and went to <hi>Portugal</hi> to acquaint himſelf with the Coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and there married; In ſayling about theſe Seas, he obſerved, that at certain ſeaſons of the year, the winds blew from the Weſt, for a great while together, and judging they came from ſome Coaſts beyond the Sea, he was ſo concerned, that he reſolved to make a Trial thereof; He was now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old, and propounding to the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> that if they would furniſh him with Ships, he would find a way by the Weſt to the Iſlands of Spices, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it as a dream or idle fancy; Being thus fruſtrate of his hopes, he goes to <hi>Portugal,</hi> and communicates his deſign to King <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> but with the ſame ſucceſs; upon which he ſent his Brother <hi>Bartholomew Columbus,</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh of <hi>England,</hi> to ſollicit his aſſiſtance, while himſelf went into <hi>Spain,</hi> to impiore aid of the <hi>Caſtilians.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bartholomew</hi> was unhappily taken by Pirates in his voyage to <hi>England,</hi> who robbing him and his company of all they had, he at length arrived, and was forced to get a mean livelyhood by making Sea Cards, and in a ſhort time preſents a Map of the World to King <hi>Henry,</hi> with his Brothers offer of diſcovery, which the King gladly accepted, and ſent for him into <hi>England;</hi> But he had ſped in his ſuit before in <hi>Spain,</hi> for coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conferring with two able <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pilots they adviſed him to apply himſelf to the Dukes of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> and <hi>Medina Caeli,</hi> who giving him recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the Queens Confeſſor, he arrived at the Court of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> in 1486. but <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella</hi> then King and Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> being ingaged hotly in the Wars of <hi>Granada</hi> againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> he at firſt found but cold entertainment. Thus he continued for ſome time in a mean and contemptible Condition, till at

length the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> procured him audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where he was favourably received, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſpatch upon concluding the Wars in <hi>Granada,</hi> and accordingly he was furniſhed with three Caravels at the Kings charges, and ſixteen thouſand Duckets in money.</p>
               <p>In 1492. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 3. <hi>Columbus</hi> accompanied with about one hundred and Twenty Perſons, ſet ſail for <hi>Gomera,</hi> one of the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, where having refreſht, after many days, they encountred the Sea called <hi>Sargaſſo,</hi> from an Herb like <hi>Sampire,</hi> wherewith it is ſo covered, that it appears like a green Field, with empty berries, like a Gooſeberry, and is ſo thick, that the Water cannot be ſeen, hindring the paſſage of the Ship, without a ſtrong wind; theſe weeds are thought to reach to the bottom of the Sea, though there exceeding deep, and above four hundred miles diſtant from the Coaſt of <hi>Africa;</hi> This ſtrange accident much ſurprized the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and had occaſioned their return, had not the ſight of ſome birds incouraged them with hopes of Land not far off; After thirty three days ſayling, deſpairing of ſucceſs, the company mutined, threatning to throw <hi>Columbus</hi> into the Sea, diſdaining that a <hi>Genouſe</hi> ſtranger ſhould thus abuſe them, but at length by ſoft words, and ſtrong promiſes he qualified their anger, <hi>Oct.</hi> 11. following, one <hi>Roderigo di Triana,</hi> cried out, <hi>Land, Land;</hi> the beſt muſick that <hi>Columbus</hi> could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, who to pacify the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had ingaged, that if no Land appeared in three days he would then return; one of the company the night before had deſcried Fire, which raiſed his expectation of having ſome great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of which being fruſtrate at his return, he in a rage renounced his Chriſtianity and turned Moor.</p>
               <p>With Tears of Joy, the late mutinous Mariners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the deſired Land, and they that Yeſterday were ready to deſtroy, now as far diſtracted with contrary paſſions, imbrace and almoſt adore their dear <hi>Columbus,</hi> for ſo happily bringing them to this Land of Promiſe;

               <p>Before the diſcovery of this Iſland by <hi>Columbus,</hi> the People were informed thereof by an Oracle, for one of their Kings being very importunate with their <hi>Zemes,</hi> or Gods, to know future events, faſted five days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſpending his time in continual mourning; After which the <hi>Zemes</hi> declared; <hi>That ſome years after there would arrive a ſtrange Nation, clothed, bearded, and armed with ſhining Swords, which would out a man aſunder in the middle, who ſhould deſtroy the ancient Images of their Gods, aboliſh their Ceremonies, and ſlay their Children.</hi> In remembrance of which Oracle they compoſed a ſolemn Elegy, which upon Holy days they uſed mournfully to ſing.

more pleaſed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than the Gold, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Inhabitants exchanged with them for Bells, Glaſſes, Points, and other Trifles. <hi>Columbus</hi> got leave of the King of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> to build a Fort, and leaving 38 <hi>Spaniards</hi> therein, taking with him ſix <hi>Indians,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Spain,</hi> and was highly careſſed by the King and Q. and being honoured with the Title of Admiral, and inriched with the Tenths of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gains in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> he is ſent a ſecond time (with his Brother <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew,</hi> who was made Vice-Roy of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi>) with ſeventeen ſail of Ships, and fifteen hundred men; when he arrived, he found all his men were murdered by the <hi>Indians,</hi> who laid the blame on their inſolent carriage toward them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Columbus</hi> now built the Town of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Saint <hi>Domingo,</hi> and Fort St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> but in both places the <hi>Spaniards</hi> died of Famine; for the <hi>Indians</hi> being unwilling to have ſuch Neighbours, refuſed to plant their Maiz and Jucca, and ſo ſtarved both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their new Gueſts. At this place the <hi>Spaniards</hi> got that terrible diſeaſe called ſince the <hi>French</hi> Pox, of the <hi>Indian</hi> women, and in requital brought among them a more mortal and infectious diſtemper, that is, the Small-Pox, which deſtroyed Thouſands, and was utterly unknown before in that Countrey. After this <hi>Columbus</hi> diſcovered <hi>Cuba, Jamaica,</hi> and other adjacent Iſles, and likewiſe part of the main Land of <hi>America;</hi> He repaired his Fleet at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> where ſome of his men were ſick, and others mutinous, which the <hi>Indians</hi> obſerving, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to bring him in proviſions, whereupon being ſtraitned, he thought of this Stratagem, ſending for ſome of the Iſlanders, he aſſured them, that if they did not furniſh him with neceſſaries, the Divine wrath would conſume them, a token whereof would be, that within two days, the face of the Moon ſhould be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at which time he knew there would be an Ecclipſe of the Moon, which theſe ſimple People find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <hi>Cortes</hi> aſked the Governour whether <hi>Montezuma</hi> had any Gold, who anſwered him, <hi>yea, I am very glad of it,</hi> ſaid <hi>Cortes, for I and my Companions are troubled with a Diſeaſe at the Heart, to which Gold is the only Soveraign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and therefore we deſire him to furniſh us with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt quantity he can poſſible of that Mettal.

given to their Gods. <hi>Cortes</hi> drawing near <hi>Mexico, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma</hi> was much afraid, ſaying, <hi>Theſe are the men whom our Gods told us ſhould inherit our Land;</hi> He then ſhut up himſelf eight days in his Oratory, praying and faſting, and ſacrificing many men to appeaſe his offended Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; The Oracle or Devil bids him not fear, but to continue theſe inhumane maſſacres, aſſuring him he ſhould have two Gods to preſerve him, ſaying, that <hi>Quezal</hi> permitted that great deſtruction at <hi>Cholola,</hi> for want of that bloudy Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cortes</hi> went forward paſſing over a Mountain ſix miles in height, covered with Snow continually, and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage very difficult, ſo that the <hi>Mexicans</hi> might eaſily have prevented his proceeding further; from hence he had ſight of the Lake whereon <hi>Mexico,</hi> and many other great Towns were built, filled with Inhabitants, and adorned with divers Temples and Towers, which beautify the Lake; being arrived at <hi>Mexico, Montezuma</hi> received him with all kind of ſolemnity, excuſing his former unkindneſſes, and providing all neceſſaries for him and his <hi>Spaniards,</hi> making Beds of Flowers for their Horſes inſtead of Litter, but <hi>Cortes</hi> being full of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſigns, ſeized upon the King, and put him in chains with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Guard of 80 men, whereupon <hi>Montezuma</hi>'s Nephew fled to arms, but by the Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his own People, was preſented to <hi>Montezuma,</hi> whom <hi>Cortes</hi> permitted to exerciſe Regal Authority, and by whoſe order he ſummoned a Parliament, or Aſſembly of the chief of his People, where he made an Oration to his Subjects, declaring, <hi>That he and his Predeceſſors were not naturally born in the Countrey, but that his Fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers came from a ſtrange Land, and that their Kings of old, had promiſed to ſend ſuch as ſhould rule them, and had accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſent theſe Spaniards.</hi> He therefore adviſed them to yield themſelves Vaſſals to the Emperour of <hi>Spain.</hi> This requeſt they yielded to, though with many tears on either ſide in thus forever departing from their Liberty. <hi>Montezuma</hi> then preſented <hi>Cortes</hi> a vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Gold and Jewels, in the nature of a Tribute,

valued at ſixteen hundred thouſand Caſtellins.</p>
               <p>Hitherto <hi>Cortes</hi> had obtained a continual victory without fighting, when he had Intelligence that <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philo de Narva,</hi> and ſome hundreds of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were ſent from <hi>Velaſques</hi> another <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain, to interrupt his proceedings, who leaving two hundred of his Men in <hi>Mexico,</hi> he with two hundred and fifty others, ſuddenly ſurprized <hi>Narva</hi> and his company, and brought him Priſoner to <hi>Mexico;</hi> While this was doing, one of <hi>Cortes</hi> his Captains at <hi>Mexico</hi> reſolved to perform ſomething in his abſence, which might render the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> dreadful &amp; terrible to the <hi>Indians,</hi> a policy they often uſed; it happened that the Nobility &amp; Commons of the City, uſed all kind of ſports &amp; recreations, to divert their Captive King, and none more than dancing and revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all night long in the ſtreets, in which divertiſements they brought forth all their Wealth, Richeſt Garments, and whatever they eſteem'd precious; The Nobility and Princes of the Royal-Bloud, exerciſed themſelves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, near the Houſes where their King was confined, there being above Two Thouſand youths, even the flower of the Nobility ingaged therein. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Captain came with a ſmall party of Souldiers, as if to be Spectators, ſending more Troops into other parts of the City, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Command to be ready at a certain ſignal, and then leading the way, he himſelf cryed out aloud, St. <hi>Jago, let us fall upon them;</hi> The watchword thus given, the Souldiers began to cut and mangle thoſe noble and delicate youths, with ſuch fury, that they left not one alive, and their rich Garments and Jewels, were made a prize by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

Arms; But they contemning his Orders, choſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Captain; when <hi>Cortes</hi> returned again, in good time to relieve his men, and <hi>Montezuma</hi> being again commanded by his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Guardians to ſpeak to the People, he was wounded on the Temples by a ſtone, whereof he died 3 daies after. <hi>Cortes</hi> had ſome Thouſands of <hi>Taxallans</hi> to aſſiſt him, and yet was forced to fly out of <hi>Mexico</hi> privately by night, with all his <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> which yet was not unknown by the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> ſo that an alarm being raiſed, they cut off their Bridges, and made a great ſlaughter among them, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> loſing moſt of their ill got Treaſure; And their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber increaſing to two hundred thouſand, they purſued them with all ſpeed, but <hi>Cortes</hi> having the good fortune to kill their Standard-bearer, the <hi>Indians</hi> forſook the Field.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Taxallans</hi> raiſing an Army of fifty thouſand men, joined with <hi>Cortes,</hi> and took in divers places, and then building ſeveral Frigots or Brigantines, he ſoon took all the <hi>Indian</hi> Canoes upon the Lake. <hi>Quabutimoc,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Montezuma,</hi> being incouraged from the Devils Oracle, made all poſſible defence for ſaving <hi>Mexico,</hi> ſometimes conquering, and being other while beaten by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who fired a great part of the City. One day the <hi>Mexicans</hi> having gotten an advantage againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they thereupon celebrated a Feaſt of Victory; The Prieſts going into the Temple, made a Perfume of ſweet Gums, and then ſacrified for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſoners, opening their breaſts, plucking out their hearts, and ſprinkling their bloud in the Air, their companions looking on, unable to revenge it, the <hi>Mexicans</hi> mean while, dancing, beating their drums, drinking themſelves drunk, and uſing all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Joy. At length Rage, Revenge and Diſdain had ſo filled the <hi>Spaniards</hi> breaſts, that having hitherto been more careful of ruining the City, which they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to preſerve for their own uſe, they now reſolved ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to deſtroy it, to which the dreadful Famine and Peſtilence within, did as much contribute, as their Fury

without; ſo that after three months Siege, <hi>Mexico</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and raſed to the ground, with the loſs of Fifty <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and Six Horſes; but of the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> an hundred thouſand, beſides thoſe who died of the Plague and Hunger; the King himſelf being taken Priſoner, and that mighty City and State utterly ſubverted; this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened <hi>Aug.</hi> 13. 1521. which day is kept as a yearly Feſtival by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to this day. <hi>Mexico</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rebuilt, with an hundred thouſand Houſes, fairer and ſtronger than before.</p>
               <p>Thus fell the Great <hi>Montezuma</hi> and his mighty Empire with him; Thus fell he who was honoured as a God, whom it was death for any of the Common People to look in the face, who never ſet his foot on the ground abroad, but was carried upon the ſhoulders of Noblemen in a Chariot of pure Gold, and if he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to alight, trod upon rich Tapeſtry; He who never put on one Garment twice, never us'd any Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or Diſh, though of Gold, but once, and yet all theſe Magnificences were ſo far from procuring him happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that they were the chief incentives to covetous and ambitious Spirits to contrive his Ruin. Yet was not this general Devaſtation without ſome prodigous forerunners of the ſame. The King of <hi>Teſcuco,</hi> a great Magician, and divers other Sorcerers, confirmed the declaration of the Idol <hi>Cholola; That a ſtrange People ſhould come and poſſeſs his Kingdom;</hi> Theſe Sorcerers being impriſoned by the King, immediately vaniſhed away; But a ſtranger thing happened by report to a poor man, who was taken up by an Eagle, and carried into a certain Cave, where being ſet down, the Eagle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced theſe words, <hi>Moſt mighty Lord, I have brought him whom thou haſt commanded;</hi> There he ſaw one like <hi>Montezuma</hi> lying aſleep, who uttering ſeveral dreadful threatnings againſt the King, the man was again carried away by the Eagle, and ſet down in the place where he had been firſt ſeized. Strange voices were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heard, with Earth quakes and overflowings of Rivers; A prodigious Bird of the bigneſs of a Crane,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57816:11"/>
was taken, having on his head as it were a Glaſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting armed men, which being brought into the Kings preſence, inſtantly diſappeared, and was never ſeen after; The King endeavoured to have appeaſed his Gods by Sacrifice, and would therefore have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved a great Stone, which yet he could not poſſibly do, by any ſtrength or other means he uſed, which was thought to be an Ominous preſage, that his Deities were not to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Theſe things were certainly told by the <hi>Indians,</hi> which if true, may be accounted the Illuſions of the Devil, whereby he ſomtimes, forwarns his Votaries.</p>
               <p n="3">III.

After his death he roſe again the third day, and after forty days aſcended into Heaven, leaving for his Vicar on Earth St.</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>and his Succeſſors, which we call Popes, one of whom hath now given the moſt Puiſſant King of</hi> Spain <hi>Emperor of the</hi> Romans, <hi>the Monarchy of the World. Obey the Pope therefore, worthy Prince, and receive the faith of Chriſt, which if you

will believe to be moſt Holy, and your own moſt falſe, you ſhall do well, but know, that if you do the contrary, we will make War upon you, and deſtroy and break your Idols to pieces; Let me then adviſe you to leave off your falſe worſhip, and thereby prevent all theſe miſchiefs.</hi>

                  <hi>Atabaliba</hi> ſeemed to wonder at the Preaching of this Frier, and replied, <hi>That he was a free Prince, and would become Tributary to none, neither did he acknowledg any greater Lord than himſelf; As for the Emperour he could be well content to be in friendſhip with ſo great a Monarch, and to be acquainted with him, but for the Pope, he would not obey him, who gave away what was none of his own, and took a Kingdom from him whom he had never ſeen; As for Religion he liked well his own, neither would nor ought he to queſtion the Truth thereof, it being ſo ancient and approved, eſpecially ſince Chriſt died, which never happened to the Sun and Moon whom he worſhipped.

He had there a ſight of the Savage In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who rowed to his Ship in Boats of Seals Skins, they eat or rather devour raw Fleſh and Fiſh, their hair was long and black, broad faces, flat noſes, colour tawny or Olive, which neither Sun nor Wind, but nature it ſelf imprinted on them, as appeared by their Infants, and ſeems to be the complexion of all the <hi>Americans;</hi> their clothing was Seals Skins, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were painted on the Cheeks, and about the Eyes with blew ſtreaks. Theſe Savages intercepted 5 <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and their Boat, they took alſo one of them, whom

they brought into <hi>England,</hi> where they arrived <hi>Oct.</hi> 2. 1576. having taken poſſeſſion of the Country, in right of the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> every man of the company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded to bring home ſomewhat in witneſs thereof; one brought a piece of black ſtone like Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal, which was found to hold Gold in a good quantity.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the next year a ſecond voyage was made to bring home more of this Ore, and coming into theſe <hi>Streights</hi> in <hi>July</hi> 1577. they found them in a manner ſhut up with a long wall of Ice, which very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered their Ships. They found a Fiſh as big as a Porpice dead upon the Shoar twelve foot long, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Horn of two yards growing out of the Snout, wreathed and ſtreight like a wax tapor, &amp; was thought to be a Sea Unicorn; It was broken on the top, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Sailers affirmed they put Spiders which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently died. It was preſented to the Queen at their return, and ſent to <hi>Winſor</hi> to be reſerved in the Wardrope for a curioſity. They went on Shoar, and had ſome skirmiſhes with the Inhabitants, who were ſo fierce and reſolute, that finding themſelves wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they leapt off the Rocks into the Sea rather than fall into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the reſt fled, only one Woman and her Child they brought away, and another man, who ſeeing the Picture of his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Ship that was taken the year before, thought him to be alive, and was very angry that he would not ſpeak to him, wondring how our People could make men live or die at their pleaſure. It was very pleaſant to obſerve the behaviour of the man and woman when they were brought together; who though put into the ſame Cabbin, ſhewed ſuch ſigns of Chaſtity, and Modeſty, as might juſtly ſhame Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who come ſo far ſhort of them; when theſe Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges would trade, their manner was to lay down ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of theirs and go their ways, expecting the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> ſhould lay down ſomething in exchange; if they like the value when they come again, they take it, otherwiſe they take away only their own; they made

ſigns that their <hi>Catchoe</hi> or King was higher of ſtature than any of ours, and carried upon mens Shoulders. They could not hear what became of their five men ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the year before, only they found ſome of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, which made them judge the Savages had eaten them; Having laden their Ship with Oar, they returned.</p>
               <p>The next year 1578. with fifteen ſail another Voyage was made by Captain <hi>Frobiſher</hi> for further diſcovery. He went on ſhoar <hi>June</hi> 20 on <hi>Frizeland,</hi> which is in length about 25 Leagues, in 57 degrees of Latitude, which he named Weſt <hi>England,</hi> where they eſpied certain Tents and People like the former, who upon their approach fled; in the Tents they found a Box of ſmall Nails, red Herrings, and boards of Fir-tree, with other things wrought very Artificially, ſo that they were either ingenious workmen themſelves, or traded with others; ſome think this to be <hi>Frieſland,</hi> and joined to <hi>Greenland.</hi> In going from hence one Ship called the <hi>Salamander</hi> ſailing with a ſtrong gale, ſtruck with ſuch violence upon the back of a Whale with her full ſtem that ſhe ſtood ſtill without motion, whereat the Whale made a hideous roaring, and lifting up his body and tail above water, ſunk inſtantly to the bottom; Two days after they found a dead Whale, which was ſuppoſed the ſame. <hi>July</hi> 2. they entred the Strieghts, the mouth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was barr'd with Mountains of Ice, wherewith a Bark was ſunk, with part of a houſe they deſigned to erect there, the men were all ſaved, and the other Ships in much danger by the ſeverity of the Ice, Fogs, and Snow. Theſe Iſlands of Ice ſeem to be congealed in the winter further North in ſome Bays or Rivers, the waters thereof being freſh, and the Sun melting the tops of the Ice rills of freſh water run down, which meeting together make an indifferent Stream; theſe Rocks being by the ſummers Sun looſed and broken from their natural Scituation, are carried whither the ſwift Current and the outragions Winds drive them.</p>

The People repreſent the <hi>Tartars</hi> in apparel and living. It is colder here in 62, than in ten degrees farther North, which happens from the cold North Eaſt Winds, which brings this ſharp Air off the Ice; The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are excellent Archers, they wear the Skins of Deer, Bears, Foxes, Hares, and of Fowls ſowed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; in the Summer the hary ſide outward, in the Winter inward, yet many go naked; they ſhoot Fiſh with their Darts, and kindle Fire by rubbing two ſticks together; The Beaſts, Fowls and Fiſhes they kill, are their Houſes, Bedding, Meat, Drink, Hoſe, Shoes Apparel, Sails Boats, and indeed all their riches; they eat all things raw, yea Graſs and Shrubs, and ſuck Ice to ſatisfy their thirſt; there is no fleſh or fiſh which they find dead, though never ſo filthy, but they will take it up and eat it, yet ſomtimes they parboil their meats in little kettles made of Beaſts Skins, the bloud and water they drink, and lick the bloody Knife with their Tongues, and uſe the ſame remedy for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their wounds, that is, licking them only with their Tongues.</p>
               <p>They have great plenty of Fowl, our men killing 15 hundred in one day; they have thicker Skins, and more Feathers than ours, which requires them to be flea'd before eaten; They have no hurtful creeping things but Spiders, and a Gnat, which is very troubleſom, nor any Timber but what the undermining water brings from other places; They are great Magicians, and when their heads ake, they tie a great Stone with a ſtring into a ſtick, and uſing certain Charms, the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57816:20"/>
Stone cannot be moved with all the force of a man, yet at other times ſeems as light as a Feather; they lie gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling with their Faces on the Ground, making a noiſe as if they Worſhiped the Devil under the Earth; they uſe great black Dogs like Wolves to draw their Sleds, and ſome of a leſſer kind they feed upon. In the midſt of Summer, they have Hail and Snow, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Foot thick, which Freezeth as it Falls, and the Ground is Frozen 3 Fathom deep, at which time the Sun is not abſent above 3 hours and an half, during which it was ſo very light, that we could ſee to read. There are no Rivers or Running Springs, but what the Sun cauſes to come from the Snow. They Row in their Leather Boats faſter with one Oar, than we can ours with all our Oars. They ſeem to have commerce with other Nations, from whom they have a ſmall quantity of Iron.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In 1585. Mr. <hi>John Davis</hi> made his firſt Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for the Northweſt Diſcovery, and in 54 Degrees, they went on Shore on an Iſland where they ſaw divers Savages, who ſeem'd to Worſhip the Sun, pointing up to it with their Hands, and therewith ſtriking their Breaſts, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> anſwering them with the ſame Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they took it for a confirmed League and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them, they then leaped and danced with a kind of Timbrel, which they ſtruck with a ſtick, their Garments were the Skins of Birds and Beaſts, they killed white Bears, one of whoſe Forefeet was fourteen Inches broad, and the Fleſh ſo fat, they were forc't to throw it away; by their dung they ſeem'd to feed on Graſs, which was like Horſe-dung, they heard tame Dogs howl on the Shore, for killing one he had a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar about his Neck, he had a Bone in his Pizel, and ſeem'd inured to the Sled, two of which they found.</p>
               <p>Next year Captain <hi>Davis</hi> made a ſecond Voyage, and found the <hi>Savage</hi> People very tractable; they are great Idolaters and Witches, having many Images which they carried about them, and in their Boats; they found a Grave wherein many were buried, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

In 66 Degrees they found it very hot, and were much troubled with Musket to Flies; all the Coaſts hereabout ſeemed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Iſlands; then returning Southward, they Coaſted <hi>Greenland,</hi> but were hindred from Harbour by the Ice, their Houſes near the Seaſide were made with pieces of Wood croſſed over with Poles, and covered with Earth; our Men plaid at Football with the Iſlanders upon the Ice. Captain <hi>Davis</hi> his third Voyage was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the next year 1587. wherein he diſcovered to 73 Degrees, finding the Sea all open, and forty Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues between the Shore on each ſide, having <hi>Greenland</hi> on the Eaſt, and <hi>America</hi> on the Weſt, near which was another Iſland, which for its dreadful aſpect, being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Snow, without Wood, Earth, or Graſs to be ſeen; and the terrible noiſe of the Ice, he named the <hi>Iſle of Deſolation,</hi> but the untimely death of Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Walſingham,</hi> hindred the further Proſecution of theſe Diſcoveries.</p>

The Natives wander in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in Summer for Hunting and Fiſhing, removing from one place to another, with their Families, Tents, and Baggage, they are of a reaſonable Stature, Brown, Active and Warlike, eat their Meat either raw or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boil'd with Blood, Oil, or a little Water which they drink; their Arrows have two Feathers, and a Bone Head, they have no Wood, but what the Sea drives aſhore. In 1606. He made a ſecond Voyage thither, and found their Winter Houſes Built with Whalebones, and covered with Earth, with Vaults two yards deep, and ſquare underground. The next year he ſailed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a third time, and in a fourth Voyage, 1612. was Slain by a Savage, in revenge as was thought of ſome of theirs formerly carried away from thence. They have Hares as white as Snow, Dogs that live on Fiſh, their Pizles, as of their Foxes, being Bone; their work in Summer is to dry their Fiſh on the Rocks. Every Man and Woman hath a Boat made of long pieces of Fir, covered with Seals Skins, and ſowed with Sinews and Guts, about 20 Foot long, and two and an half broad, like a Weavers Shuttle, ſo light and ſwift, that no Ship with any Wind is able to hold way with them, and yet uſe but one Oar, which they hold by the middle in the midſt of their Boar, wherewith they Row forward and backward at pleaſur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>December</hi> their Fire could not heat them, their Sack was frozen, &amp; they were forced to melt it, their Beer when thawed drunk like water; They endeavoured to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it with Sea-coal fire, as being hotter than wood, and ſtopped the Chimney and Doors to keep in the heat, when they inſtantly ſwounded away for want of Air; Their Shoes froze as hard as horns to their feet, and when they ſate at the fire while they were almoſt burnt on the forepart, they were frozen white on their backs; The Snow roſe higher than the Houſe, which in clear weather they endeavoured to remove, cutting out ſteps, and aſcending up as out of a Vault or Cellar; when neither Cloths nor great fires would keep out the cold, they were forced to heat Stones and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them burning hot to their feet and bodys; in one night a barrel of water was turned into Ice; They ſaw no Sun from <hi>November</hi> 3. to <hi>Jan.</hi> 24. a long night of fifty two days; When the Sun had left them, they ſaw the Moon continually day and night never going

               <p>After they had Sailed herein near 300 Leagues Weſt, he came to a ſmall Streight of two Leagues over, and very deep Water, through which he paſſed between

the two Capes, one of which he called <hi>Digges Iſland</hi> in 62 Degrees, into a ſpacious Sea, wherein he ſailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred Leagues South, being now over-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that he had found the Paſſage, but perceiving by the Shoal Water, that it was only a Bay, he was much ſurprized, committing many errors, eſpecially in reſolving to Winter in that deſolate place, in ſuch want of neceſſary Proviſions. <hi>November</hi> 3.

               <p>At the opening of the year there came to the ſide of his Ship ſuch a multitude of fiſh of all ſorts, that they might eaſily have fraught themſelves for their return, if <hi>Hudſon</hi> had not too deſperately purſued his Voyage, neglecting this opportunity of ſtoring themſelves, which he committed to the care of certain careleſs diſſolute Villains, who in his abſence conſpired againſt him; in few days all the fiſh forſook them; one time a Savage viſited them who for a Knife, Glaſs, and Beads, gave them Bever and Deers Skin, with a Sled: At <hi>Hudſons</hi> return they ſet Sail for <hi>England,</hi> but in few dayes their Victuals being almoſt ſpent and he in deſpair, letting fall ſome words of ſetting ſome on ſhore, the Conſpirators entred his Cabin in the night, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Hudſon,</hi> his Son and ſix more, to go out of the ſhip into the Shallop and ſeek their Fortune, after which they were never heard of, but certainly periſhed in the Sea.

               <p>Being ſomewhat recovered of his wounds, he falls with his Ships into the Sound of <hi>Darien,</hi> where he found a certain People called <hi>Symerons,</hi> which are for the moſt part <hi>Negro's,</hi> and ſuch as having been Slaves to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> by reaſon of their cruelty and hard uſage run away from them, and live in woods and wild places of the Countrey in great companies together like other Savages, hating the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deadly, and doing them what miſchief they can upon all occaſions; By theſe he got Intelligence that a <hi>Requa,</hi> as they call it, or a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Mules, commonly 40 or 50 in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany laden with Treaſure and other things was to paſs in few daies from <hi>Panama</hi> in the South Sea to <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> to be ſhipped from thence for <hi>Spain,</hi> which he therefore reſolved, if it were poſſible, to ſurprize.

               <p>Having therefore engaged a ſufficient number of theſe <hi>Symerons</hi> with no more than eighteen reſolved men of his own, leaving the reſt with the ſhips, they marcht by night over the ſtrait of <hi>Darien,</hi> ſo called, as being that Neck of Land that joins the Northern and Southern part of <hi>America</hi> together, and is not above 20 mile over from Sea to Sea, though many Leagues long; They travelled undiſcovered within a Leagues of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama,</hi> and lodged themſelves in a wood on each ſide the Road where the Mules were to paſs, who at length came, ſo tyed one to another, as the manner is, that by ſtopping one, all the reſt ſtand ſtill.

               <p>Having gone about 14 Leagues, they came to a River which the <hi>Symerons</hi> told them ran directly into the South Sea; Here they cut down wood, and built themſelves a Pinnace about 45 foot long, wherein they put to Sea, making toward the <hi>Iſland of Pearls</hi> 25 Leagues South of <hi>Panama</hi> hoping ſome Ships from <hi>Peru</hi> or other places from the South would be ſailing that way for <hi>Panama.</hi> So that though Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> hath deſervedly the honour of firſt diſcovering the South Sea to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the open and known way of the Streights, yet Captain <hi>Oxenham</hi> was the firſt <hi>Engliſhman</hi> that ever ſailed upon it with command.

               <p>The Captain himſelf through the obſtinacy and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſome of the Company, was forced to leave the Treaſure with them, and Travel ſome Leagues up into the Country, to find <hi>Negro's</hi> that might help him to carry it, his own Men refuſing to do it, but quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with him for larger pay.

Nations, and of each how many Sail of ſhips, go year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fiſh for theſe Cods, with the prodigious quantity they take, one man catching an hundred in an hour; They fiſh with Hooks which are no ſooner thrown into the Sea but the greedy Fiſh ſnapping the Bait is taken, and drawn on ſhipboard, where they lay him on a Plank, one cuts off his head, another guts him, and takes out its biggeſt bones, another ſalts and barrels it, which being thus ordered is hence tranſported by the <hi>European</hi> Nations to all parts of Chriſtendom, yea throughout moſt other parts of the world; They fiſh only in the day, the Cod not biting in the night, nor doth this fiſhing laſt all ſeaſons, but begins toward Spring, and ends in <hi>September,</hi> for in Winter they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the bottom of the Sea, where ſtorms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts have no Power.</p>
               <p>Near theſe Coaſts is another kind of fiſhing for Cod which they call <hi>Dried,</hi> as the other <hi>Green Fiſh.</hi> The Ships retire into ſome Harbour, &amp; every morning ſend forth their Shallops two or three Leagues into the Sea, who fail not of their Load by noon or ſoon after, which they bring to Land and order as the other, after this Fiſh hath layn ſome days in Salt they take it out and dry it in the wind laying it again in heaps, and expoſing it dayly to the open Air till it be dry, which ought to be good and Temperate to make the Fiſh ſaleable, for Miſts moiſten and make it rot, and the Sun cauſes yellowneſs. At this their fiſhing, the Mariners have likewiſe the pleaſure of taking Fowl without going out of their Veſſels, for baiting their Hook with the Cods Liver theſe Fowls are ſo greedy that they come by Flocks, and fight who ſhall get the bait firſt, which ſoon proves its death, and one being taken the Hook is no ſooner thrown out but another is inſtantly catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p>Though the Planting of this Country by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> was deſigned by divers, yet it lay much neglected till a ſmall Company of Planters under the Command of Captain <hi>George Popham,</hi> and Captain <hi>Gilbert</hi> were ſent over at the charge of Sir <hi>John Popham,</hi> in 1606 to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a Colony upon a tract of Land about <hi>Saga de hoch</hi> the moſt Northerly part of <hi>New-England,</hi> but that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign within two years expiring with its firſt Founder, ſoon after ſome Honourable Perſons of the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> commonly called the Council of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> being more certainly informed of ſeveral Navigable Rivers, and commodious Havens, with other places fit either for Traffick or Planting, newly diſcovered by many ſkilful Navigators, obtained of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, a Patent under the Great Seal of all that part of <hi>North-America</hi> called <hi>New-England,</hi> from Forty to Forty eight Degrees of North Latitude. This vaſt Tract of Land, was in 1612. cantoned and divided by Grants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many leſſer parcels, according as Adventurers preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which Grants being founded upon uncertain and falſe Deſcriptions, and Reports of ſome that Travelled thither, did much interfere one upon another to the great diſturbance of the firſt Planters, ſo that little Profit was reaped from thence, nor was any greater Improvement made of thoſe Grand Portions of Land, ſave the erecting ſome few Cottages for Fiſhermen, and a few inconſiderable Buildings for the Planters; yea for want of good conduct they were by degrees in a manner quite deſtitute of Laws and Government, and left to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
               <p>This was the beginning of <hi>New-England,</hi> when in the year 1610. One Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> a Presbyterian, or rather Independent Preacher, and ſeveral other <hi>Engliſh</hi> then at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> though they had been courteouſly entertained by the <hi>Dutch</hi> as Strangers, yet foreſeeing many inconveniences might happen, and that they could not ſo well provide for the good of their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57816:39"/>
under the Government of a Foreign Nation, they reſolved to intreat ſo much favour from their own So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Prince, King <hi>James,</hi> as to grant them liberty under the ſhelter of his Royal Authority, to place them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome part of <hi>New-England;</hi> having therefore obtained ſome kind of Patent or Grant for ſome place about <hi>Hudſons River,</hi> they ſet Sail from <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> for the Southern parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> but as they intended their courſe thitherward, they were through many dangers, at laſt, about <hi>November</hi> 11, caſt upon a boſom of the South Cape of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets</hi> Bay, called <hi>Cape Cod.</hi> When Winter approached ſo faſt that they had no opportunity to remove, and finding ſome Incouragement from the hopefulneſs of the Soil, and courteſie of the Heathen, they reſolved there to make their aboad, laying the Foundation of a new Colony, which from the laſt Town they Sailed from in <hi>England</hi> they named <hi>New Plymouth,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no conſiderable Tract of Land, ſcarce extending an hundred Miles in length through the whole Cape, and not half ſo much in breadth where broadeſt.</p>
               <p>From this time to the year 1636. things were very proſperouſly &amp; ſucceſsfully carried on in <hi>New-England,</hi> which was much increaſed in Buildings and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, at which time the <hi>Naraganſet Indians,</hi> who are the moſt warlike and Feirce, and much dreaded by all the reſt, committed many barbarous outrages upon ſome of them, and likewiſe upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> as they came occaſionally to trade with them, barbarouſly murdering Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> Captain <hi>Oldham</hi> and others, whereupon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of all the Colonies unanimouſly falling upon them in 1637. they were eaſily ſuppreſſed, about 700 of them being deſtroyed, and the reſt cut off by their Neighbour <hi>Indians;</hi> Upon which <hi>Miantonimoh</hi> the Cheif of the <hi>Mogehins</hi> expecting to be Sole Lord and Ruler over all the <hi>Indians,</hi> committed many Inſolencies upon ſome others who were in confederacy with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as himſelf, and he being ſent for to the

               <p>Upon a due inquiry therefore of all the Tranſactions between the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> from their firſt ſetling on theſe Coaſts there will appear no Ground of quarrel, or provocation given by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For when <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony was firſt planted in 1620. within three months after <hi>Maſſaſoit</hi> the chief <hi>Sachem</hi> or Commander of all that ſide of the Country repaired thither to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and entred Solemnly into a League upon the following Articles. 1, <hi>That neither he nor any of his ſhould injureor do hurt to any of their People.</hi> 2. <hi>If any of his hurt the</hi> Engliſh <hi>he ſhould ſend them the Offender to puniſh.</hi> 3. <hi>If any thing ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by his, he ſhould ſee it reſtored and the</hi> Engliſh <hi>to do the like to them.</hi> 4. <hi>If any made War unjuſtly againſt him they</hi> were to <hi>aid</hi> him, and <hi>he likewiſe them.</hi> 5. <hi>that he ſhould certify his Neighbour Confederates hereof, that they might be likewiſe comprized in the Peace.</hi> 6. <hi>That when his men ſhould come to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>they ſhould leave their Arms behind.</hi> Which were then Bows and Arrows, and were then their only weapons though now they have learned the uſe of Guns and Swords as well as the hriſtians. This League the ſame Sachem confirmed a little before his death in 1630. coming with his 2 Sons <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and renewing the ſame for

himſelf, his Heirs and ſucceſſors; Yet it is apparent this <hi>Maſſaſoit</hi> never loved the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and would have ingaged them never to have attempted to draw away any of his People from their old <hi>Pagan</hi> ſuperſtition and deviliſh Idolatry to the Chriſtian Religion, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would make no Treaty with him upon ſuch conditions he urged it no further. But this was a bad Omen, that whatever kindneſs he pretended to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> yet he hated them for being Chriſtians; which ſtrain was more apparent in his Son that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him and all his People, inſomuch that ſome diſcerning Perſons of that Juriſdiction were afraid that that part of the <hi>Indians</hi> would be all rooted out as it is ſince come to paſs.</p>
               <p>Neither was <hi>Paſſaconaway</hi> the great Sagamore or Sachim of <hi>Merimack</hi> River inſenſible of the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of oppoſing the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for a Perſon of Quality relates, that being invited by ſome Sachims to a great Dance in 1660. <hi>Paſſaconaway</hi> intending at that time to make his laſt and farewel Speech to his Children and People that were then all gathered together, he addreſſed himſelf to them in this manner; <hi>I am now going the way of all fleſh, or ready to die, and not likely to ſee you ever met together any more, I will now leave this word of Counſel with you, that you take heed how you quarrel with the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>for though you may do them much miſchief yet aſſuredly you will all be deſtroyed and rooted off the Earth it you do: For I was as much an Enemy to them as their firſt coming into theſe parts as any one whatſoever, and tryed all ways and Means poſſible to have deſtroyed them, at leaſt to have prevented them ſitting down here, but could no way effect it, therefore I adviſe you never to contend with the</hi> Engliſh <hi>nor make War with them.</hi> And accordingly his eldeſt Son as ſoon as he perceived the <hi>Indians</hi> were up in Arms, with drew himſelf into ſome remote place that he might not be hurt either by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Indians.</hi> It is obſervable that this <hi>Paſſaconoway</hi> was the moſt noted Pawaw and Sorcerer of all the Country, and might therefore like <hi>Balaam</hi> at that time utter this from ſome divine Illumination.</p>

After his death <hi>Philip</hi> his Brother, Nick-named King <hi>Philip,</hi> for his haughty Spirit came in his own Perſon in 1662, with <hi>Sauſaman</hi> his Chief Secretary and Counſellor, to renew the former Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that had been made with his Predeceſſors, and there was as much correſpondence betwixt them for the next ſeven years, as had ever been in former times, and yet without any kind of provocation, this treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Caitiff in 1676. harboured miſcheivous thoughts again them, plotting a General Inſurrection in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, all the <hi>Indians</hi> being to riſe as one man againſt the Plantations which were next them; which being diſcovered by <hi>John Sauſaman, Philip</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon cauſed him to be murdered, the Murderers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended were Executed, and <hi>Philip</hi> fearing his own Head, got openly into Arms, killing, burning and deſtroying the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and their Habitations, with all manner of Barbarity and Cruelty, which troubles continued almoſt two years, till at length after ſeveral defeats given to <hi>Philip</hi> and his Forces, the loſs of his Friends, bereavement of his dear Wife and beloved

               <p>For ſuch was his inveteracy againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that he could not bear any thing ſhould be ſuggeſted to him about Peace; inſomuch that he cauſed one of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to be killed for propounding it, which ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked ſome of his Company not altogether ſo deſperate as himſelf, that one of them who was near akin to him that was killed fled to <hi>Road Iſland,</hi> and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Captain <hi>Church</hi> were <hi>Philip</hi> was, offering to lead him thither; Upon this welcome news a ſmall Party of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> came very early in the morning and ſurrounded his Swamp, from whence as he was endeavouring to make his eſcape, he was ſhot through the heart by an <hi>Indian</hi> of his own Nation, for Captain <hi>Church</hi> having appointed an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> and an <hi>Indian</hi> to ſtand at ſuch a place of the Swamp where it hapned that Philip was breaking through, the morning being very wet and rainy the <hi>Engliſhmans</hi> Gun would not fire, the <hi>Indian</hi> having an old Muſket with a larg touchhole, it took Fire the more readily, with which <hi>Philip</hi> was diſpatcht, the bullet paſſing directly through his Heart. ſoon after ſeveral of his Confederates and Counſellors were taken, and ſuffered deſerved puniſhment, and in a while moſt of theſe murderers received their condign rewards.

                  <hi>Sept.</hi> 19. 1677. About Sun-ſet I and another man being together, the <hi>Indians</hi> with great ſhouting and ſhooting came upon us, and ſome other of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hard by, at which we ran to a Swamp for refuge, which they perceiving, made after us, and ſhot at us, three Guns being diſcharged upon me; the Swamp being miry, I ſlipt in and fell down, whereupon an <hi>Indian</hi> ſtept to me with his Hatchet lift up, to knock me on the head, ſuppoſing I was wounded, and unfit for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; it hapned I had a Piſtol in my Pocket, which though uncharged, I preſented to him, who preſently ſtept back, and told me, if I would yield, I ſhould have no hurt, boaſting falſly that they had deſtroyed all <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and that the Woods were full of <hi>Indians,</hi> whereupon I yielded my ſelf, and ſo fell into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, and by three of them was led away to the place whence I firſt fled, where two other <hi>Indians</hi> came running to us, and one lifting up the But-end of his Gun to knock me on the head, the other with his hand put by the blow, and ſaid, I was his friend. I was now near my own Houſe, which the <hi>Indians</hi> burnt laſt year, and I was about to build up again, and there I had ſome hopes to eſcape from them; there was a Horſe juſt by which they bid me take, I did ſo, but attempted no eſcape, becauſe the Beaſt was dull and ſlow, and I thought they would ſend me to take my own Horſes, which they did, but they were ſo frighted that I could not come near them, and ſo fell again into the Enemies hands, who now took me, bound me, and led me away. Soon after I was brought to other Captives, who were that day taken at <hi>Hatfield,</hi> which moved two contrary Paſſions, Joy to have company, and Sorrow that we were in this miſerable condition: We were all pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioned, and led away in the night over the Mountains in dark and hideous ways about four Miles further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we took up our place of reſt, which was in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal place of a Wood on the Eaſt-ſide of that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; we were kept bound all that night, the <hi>Indians</hi> watching us, who as they travelled made ſtrange noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

               </p>
               <p>About break of day we marched again, and got over the great River of <hi>Pecomptuck,</hi> there the <hi>Indians</hi> marked out upon Trays the number of their Captives and and Slain, as their manner is: Here I was again in great danger, a quarrel ariſing whoſe Captive I was, and I was afraid I muſt be killed to end the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie; they then aſked me whoſe I was, I ſaid, three <hi>Indians</hi> took me, ſo they agreed to have all a ſhare in me; I had now three Maſters, but the chief was he who firſt laid hands on me, which hapned to be the worſt of the company, as <hi>Aſhpelon</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Captain told me, who was always very kind to me, and a great comfort to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> In this place they gave us Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals which they had brought away from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ten Men were again ſent out for more plunder, ſome of whom brought Proviſion, others corn out of the Meadows upon Horſes; from hence we went up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Falls, where we croſt that River again, when I fell downright Lame of my old Wounds received in the War, but the apprehenſion of being killed by the <hi>Indians</hi> and what cruel death they would put me to, ſoon frighted away my pain, and I was very brisk again. We had eleven Horſes in that Company, which carried Burdens, and the Women; we Travelled up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till Night, and then took up our Lodging in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal place, being laid on our Backs and ſtaked down, in which poſture we lay many Nights together, the manner was, our Arms and Legs being ſtretched out, were ſtaked faſt down, and a Cord put about our Necks, ſo that we could not poſſibly ſtir; the firſt Night being much tired, I ſlept as comfortable as ever, the next we lay in the <hi>Squahag</hi> Meadows, our Proviſion was ſoon ſpent, and whilſt we were there, the <hi>Indians</hi> went a Hunting, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army came out after us.

               <p>In this place they built a long Wigwam, and had a great Dance, as they called it, where it was conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to burn three of us, having provided Bark for that purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom, as I heard afterward, I was to be one, Serjeant <hi>Plympton</hi> another, and the wife of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Wait</hi> the third; I knew not then who they were, yet I underſtood ſo much of their Language that I perceived ſome were deſigned thereto; That night I could not ſleep for fear of the next days work, the <hi>Indians</hi> weary with dancing lay down and ſlept ſoundly; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were all looſe, whereupon I went out for Wood and mended the Fire, making a noiſe on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but none awaked, I thought if any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould wake we might kill them all ſleeping, to which end I removed out of the way all the Guns and Hatchets, but my heart failing I put all things where they were again. The next day when they intended to burn us our Maſter and ſome others ſpoke for us, and the Evil was prevented at this time; we lay here about three weeks, where I had a ſhirt brought me to make, one <hi>Indian</hi> ſaid it ſhould be made this way, another a different way, and a third his way, whereupon I told them I would make it according to my cheife Maſters Order; Upon this an <hi>Indian</hi> ſtruck me on the face with his Fiſt, I ſuddenly roſe in anger to return it again which raiſed a great Habbub, the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming about me, I was fain to humble my ſelf to my Maſter which ended the matter. Before I came to this place my three Maſters were gone a hunting, and I was left with only one <hi>Indian</hi> (all the company being upon a March) who fell ſick ſo that I was fain to carry his Gun and Hatchet whereby I had opportunity to have

One of the <hi>Indian</hi> Captains and always our great friend met me coming in and told me <hi>Stebbins</hi> was run away, and the <hi>Indians</hi> ſpoke of burning us, ſome were only for burning our fingers, and then biting them off; He ſaid there would be a Court and all would ſpeak their minds, but he would ſpeak laſt and declare, That the <hi>Indian</hi> who ſuffered <hi>Stebbins</hi> to make his eſcape was only in fault, and bid us not fear any hurt ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us, and ſo it proved accordingly.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we lingred hereabout, Proviſion grew ſcarce, one Bears foot muſt ſerve five of us a whole day, we began to eat Horsfleſh, and devoured ſeveral Horſes three only being left alive.

Here I was frozen, and here again we were like to ſtarve, all the <hi>Indians</hi> went a Hunting but could get nothing, ſeveral days they Pawawed or Conjured but to no purpoſe, then they deſired the Engliſh to Pray, confeſſing they could do nothing and would have us try what the Engliſhmans God could do.

till it was all eaten, and then entring upon the Lake, a Storm aroſe, which indangered us all, but at laſt we got to an Iſland, and there the <hi>Indians</hi> went to Powaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Conjuring; the Powaw declared that <hi>Benjamin Wait</hi> and another were coming, and that Storm was raiſed to caſt them away; This afterward appeared to be true, though then I believed it not, upon this Iſland we lay ſtill ſeveral days, and then ſet out again, but a Storm took us, ſo that we continued to and fro upon certain Iſlands about three Weeks; we had no Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion but Racoons, that the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves were afraid of being Starved; they would give me nothing, whereby I was ſeveral days without any victuals. At length we went upon the Lake on the Ice, having a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sled, upon which we drew our Loads before Noon I tired, and juſt then the <hi>Indians</hi> met with ſome <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> one of the <hi>Indians</hi> who took me, came and called me all manner of ill names, throwing me on my Back, I told him I could do no more, then he ſaid he muſt kill me, which I thought he was about to do, for pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out his Knife, he cut off my Pockets and wrapt them about my Face, and then helped me up, and took my Sled and went away, giving me a bit of Bisket like a Walnut, which he had of the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and told me he would give me a Pipe of Tobacco; when my Sled was gone, I ran after him, but being tired, ſoon fell to a foot pace, whereby the <hi>Indians</hi> were out of ſight, I followed as well as I could, having many falls upon the Ice, at length I was ſo ſpent, I had not ſtrength enough to riſe again, but crept to a Tree that lay along, upon which I continued all the cold Night, it being very ſharp Weather.</p>
               <p>I now counted no other but that I muſt here die, which whilſt I was ruminating of, an <hi>Indian</hi> hollow'd, and I anſwered, he came to me and called me bad names, telling me if I would not go, he muſt knock me on the head, I told him he muſt then do ſo, he ſaw how I had wallowed in the Snow, but could not me, hereupon he wrapt me in his Coat, and going

back, ſent two <hi>Indians</hi> with a Sled, one ſaid he muſt knock me on the head, the other ſaid no, they would carry me away and burn me; then they bid me ſtir my Inſtep, to ſee if that were Frozen, I did ſo, when they ſaw that, they ſaid there was a Surgeon with the <hi>French,</hi> that could cure me, then they took me upon a Sled, and carried me to the Fire, making much of me, pulling off my wet, and wrapping me in dry Cloths, laying me in a good Bed; they had killed an Otter, and gave me ſome of the Broth, and a bit of the Fleſh, here I ſlept till toward day, and was then able to get up, and put on my Cloths; one of the <hi>Indians</hi> awaked, and ſeeing me go, ſhouted as rejoicing at it. As ſoon as it was light, I and <hi>Samuel Ruſſel</hi> went afore on the Ice upon a River, they ſaid I muſt go on Foot as much as I could for fear of Freezing, <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſlipt into the River with one Foot, the <hi>Indians</hi> called him back, and dried his Stockings, and then ſent us away with an <hi>Indian</hi> Guide, we went four or five Miles before the reſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> overtook us, I was then pretty well ſpent, <hi>Ruſſel</hi> ſaid he was faint, and wondred how I could live, for he ſaid he had ten Meals to my one; I was then laid on the Sled, and they ran away with me on the Ice, the reſt and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> came ſoftly after, whoſe Face I never ſaw more, nor know what became of him. About Midnight we got neer <hi>Shamblee</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Town where the River was open; when I came to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, I was not able, whereupon an <hi>Indian</hi> who ſtaid with me would carry me a few Rods, and then I would go as many, telling me I would dye if he did not carry me, and that I muſt tell the <hi>Engliſh</hi> how kind he was.</p>
               <p>When we came to the firſt Houſe there was no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, the <hi>Indian</hi> and I were both ſpent and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, he ſaid we muſt now both die; at laſt he left me alone, and got to another Houſe, from whence came ſome <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who brought me in, the <hi>French</hi> were very kind, putting my hands and feet in cold Water, and gave me a dram of Brandy, with a little Haſty-pudding and Milk; when I taſted Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,

I was very hungry, but they would not ſuffer me to eat too much; I lay by the Fire with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> that night, yet could not ſleep for pain; next morning the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> fell out about me, the <hi>Indians</hi> ſaying, that the <hi>French</hi> loved the <hi>Engliſh</hi> better than the <hi>Indians.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> preſently turned the <hi>Indians</hi> out of doors, being very careful of me, and all the men in the Town came to ſee me; here I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three or four days, and was invited from one Houſe to another, receiving much civility from a young man, who let me lie in his Bed, and would have bought me, but that the <hi>Indians</hi> demanded an hundred pound; we travelled to a place called <hi>Surril,</hi> whither this young man accompanied me, to prevent my being abuſed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> he carried me on the Ice one days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for now I could not go at all, when we came to the place the People were kind.

Towns they have none, removing always from one place to another for conveniency of food, ſometimes where one ſort of Fiſh is plentiful, and then where another. I have ſeen an hundred of their Wigwams together in a piece of ground, which ſhews prettily, and within a week they have all vaniſhed.

               <p>The Town of <hi>New-York</hi> is well ſeated both for Trade, ſecurity and pleaſure, in a ſmall Iſle called <hi>Manahatan,</hi> at the mouth of the great River <hi>Mohegan,</hi> which is very commodious for Shipping, and about two Leagues broad, the Town is large, built with <hi>Dutch</hi> Brick, <hi>alla Moderna,</hi> conſiſting of above 500 fair Houſes, the meaneſt not valued under one hundred Pounds, to the Landward it is incompaſſed with a Wall of good thickneſs, and fortified at the entrance of the River, ſo as to command any Ship which paſſes that way by a Fort called <hi>James-Fort:</hi> It hath a Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, a Sheriff, and Juſtices of Peace for their Magiſtrates; the Inhabitants are moſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and have a conſiderable Trade with the <hi>Indians,</hi> for Bever, Otter, Racoon Skins, with other rich Furs; likewiſe for Bear, Deer and Elk Skins, and are ſupplyed with Veniſon and Fowl in the Winter, and Fiſh in the Summer by the <hi>Indians,</hi> at an eaſy Price.</p>
               <p>The Province of <hi>New-York</hi> formerly contained all that Land, which lies in the North-parts of <hi>America,</hi> betwixt <hi>New-England</hi> and <hi>Mary-Land,</hi> the length to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the North is not fully known, the breadth is about 200 Miles, the principal Rivers are <hi>Hudſons</hi> River, <hi>Raritan</hi> River, and <hi>Delaaware</hi> Bay, the chief Iſlands are the <hi>Manahatan</hi> Iſland, <hi>Long</hi> Iſland, and <hi>Staten</hi> Iſland;

               <p>There are now but few <hi>Indians</hi> upon the Iſland, and theſe not unſerviceable to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> being ſtrangely decreaſed ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt ſetled there, for not long ago there were ſix Towns full of them, which are now reduced to two Villages, the reſt being cut off by Wars among themſelves, or ſome raging mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſeaſes. They live principally by Hunting, Fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fiſhing, their Wives tilling the Land, and planting the Corn; They feed on Fiſh, Fowl and Veniſon, likewiſe Polcats, Turtles, Racoon and the like; They build ſmall moveable Tents, which they remove three times a year, cheifly quartering where they plant their Corn, beſides their Hunting and Fiſhing Quarters. Their Recreations are cheifly Football and Cards, at which they will play away all they have, except a Flap to cover their nakedneſs; They are great Lovers of ſtrong drink, ſo that except they have enough to be drunk, they care not to drink at all; If there be ſo many in a company that there is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prieſt takes the money and putting it into ſome diſhes, ſets them upon the top of their low flat-roofed Houſes, and falls to invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating their God to come and receive it, which with many loud hollows and outcries, ſtriking the ground with ſticks, and beating themſelves is performed by the Prieſt, and ſeconded by the People. After being thus wearied, a Devil by this Conjuration appears amongſt them, ſometimes in the ſhape of a Fowle, a Beaſt, or a Man, at which the People being amazed not daring to ſtir, the Prieſt improves the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſtepping out makes ſure of the money, and then returns to lay the Spirit, who is ſometimes gone before he comes back, having taken ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany along with him, but if at ſuch times any <hi>Engliſh</hi> come among them it puts a period to their proceeding, and they will deſire his abſence, ſaying their God will not come till they are departed. In their Wars they fight no pitcht Battel, but upon their enemies approach, (having firſt ſecured their Wives and Children in ſome Iſland or thick Swamp) armed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57816:52"/>
with Guns and Hatchets, they way-lay their Enemies and 'tis counted a great fight where ſeven or eight are ſlain.</p>
               <p>When an <hi>Indian</hi> dies they bury him upright ſitting upon a ſeat, with his Gun, money, and goods, to furniſh him in the other World, which they conceive is Weſtward, where they ſhall have great ſtore of Game for Hunting and live at eaſe; At his buriall his neareſt Relations paint their faces black, and make ſad lamentations at his Grave once or twice every day, till by time the blackneſs is worn off their faces, and after that once a year they mourn a freſh for him viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and trimming up the Grave, not ſuffering any Graſs to grow neer it, fencing it with a hedg, and covering it with Mats for a ſhelter from the rain. Notwithſtanding all this buſtle, when an <hi>Indian</hi> is dead his name dies with him, none daring ever after to mention his name, it being not only a breach of their Law, but an affront to his Friends and Relations, as if done on purpoſe to renew their greife. And every Perſon who hath the ſame Name inſtantly changes it for another, which every one invents for himſelf, ſome calling themſelves <hi>Ratleſnake,</hi> others <hi>Buckshorn</hi> or the like; Yea if a Perſon die whoſe Name is ſome word uſed in common ſpeech, they change that word, and invent a new one, which makes a troubleſome alteration in their Language. When any one is ſick, after ſome means uſed by his Friends every one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſkill in Phyſick, that proving ineffectual, they ſend for a Pawaw or Prieſt, who ſitting down by the ſick Perſon without the leaſt inquiry after the diſtemper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects a Fee or gift, according to which he proportions his work, beginning with a low voice to call ſometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one God, and then another, ſtill raiſing his voice, beating his naked breaſts and ſides till the ſweat runs down, and his breath is almoſt gone, the little that remains he breathes upon the face of the ſick Perſon three or four times together, and ſo takes his leave.</p>
               <p>Their Weddings are performed without any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the Match being firſt made by mony which

being agreed on and given to the woman make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the Marrage if we may ſo call it; After which he keeps her during pleaſure, and upon the leaſt diſlike turns her away and takes another. It is no offence for their married women to lie with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man provided ſhe acquaint her huſband, or ſome of her neareſt Relations therewith, but if not, they account it ſuch a fault as is ſometimes puniſhable by death; ſome write that when an <hi>Indian</hi> woman finds her ſelf with Child, ſhe continues Chaft or untou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by man until her delivery, the like ſhe obſerves in her giving ſuck, a ſtrange Cuſtom, which our <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> Ladys would not well reliſh. An <hi>Indian</hi> may have two, three or more wives if he pleaſe, but it is not now ſo much uſed as before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came, they being inclined to imitate them in things both good and bad. Any Maid before ſhe is married lies with whom ſhe pleaſe for Mony, without the leaſt Scandal or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion, it being not only cuſtomary but lawful. They are extream charitable to each other, for if any one has to ſpare, he freely imparts it to his Freinds, and whatever they get by gaming or otherwiſe they ſhare one with another, leaving commonly the leaſt part to themſelves.</p>
               <p>At their <hi>Cantica's</hi> or Dancing Matches, all perſons that come are freely entertain'd, it being then Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val time, their Cuſtom is that all but the Dancers have a ſhort ſtick wherewith they ſtrike the ground, and ſing altogether, while thoſe that Dance ſometimes Act warlike Poſtures, and then come in with faces painted black and Red like Warriors, or ſome all black, others all red, with ſtreaks of white under their Eyes, and ſo jump and hop about without any Order, uttering many expreſſions of their deſigned valour; In other Dances they only ſhew what Antick Tricks their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will lead them to, wringing their Bodies and Faces in a ſtrange manner, ſometimes leaping into the Fire, then catching up a Fire-brand, and biting off a live coal with many ſuch tricks, which more affright than pleaſe an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> reſembling rather a Crew of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal

Furies than reaſonable Creatures; when their King or <hi>Sachem</hi> ſits in Council, he hath a Company of armed men to Guard his Perſon, great reſpect being ſhewed him by the People, which chiefly appears by their ſilence; After he has declared the cauſe of their Convention he demands their Opinions, ordering who ſhall begin firſt, who having delivered his mind, tells them he hath done, for no man interrupts him, though he make never ſo many long ſtops and halts, till he ſays he has no more to ſay; The Council having all deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Opinions, the King after ſome pauſe gives the definitive ſentence, which is commonly ſeconded with a ſhout from the People, thereby ſignifying their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or applauſe. If any Perſon be condemned to dye, which is ſeldom but for murder or inceſt, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf goes out in Perſon, (for they have no Priſons, and the guilty Perſon flies into the woods) to ſeek him out, and having found him, the King ſhoots firſt, though at never ſuch a diſtance, and then happy is the man that can ſhoot him down, who for his pains is made ſome Captain or military Officer.</p>

The Country it ſelf in its <hi>Soil, Air, Water, Seaſons</hi> and <hi>Produce</hi> both Natural and Artificial is not to be deſpiſed. The <hi>Land</hi> containeth divers ſorts of <hi>Earth,</hi> as <hi>Sand</hi> Yellow and Black, Poor and Rich: alſo <hi>Gravel</hi> both Loomy and Duſty; and in ſome places a <hi>faſt fat Earth,</hi> like to our beſt <hi>Vales</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by <hi>Inland-Brooks</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> God in his Wiſdom having ordered it ſo, that the <hi>Advantages</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> are divided, the <hi>Back-Lands</hi> being generally <hi>three</hi> to <hi>one</hi> Richer than thoſe that ly by <hi>Navigable Waters.</hi> We have much of another <hi>Soyl,</hi> and that is a <hi>black Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel-Mould,</hi> upon a <hi>Stony</hi> or <hi>Rocky</hi> bottom. The <hi>Air</hi> is ſweet and cleer, the Heavens ſerene, like the <hi>South-parts</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> rarely <hi>Overcaſt;</hi> and as the <hi>Woods</hi> come by numbers of People to be more <hi>clear'd,</hi> that it ſelf will Refine. The <hi>Waters</hi> are generally good, for the <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Brooks</hi> have moſtly <hi>Gravel</hi> and <hi>Stony Bottoms,</hi> and in Number hardly credible. We have alſo <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters,</hi> that operate in the ſame manner with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> and <hi>North-Hall,</hi> not two Miles from <hi>Philadelphia.</hi> For the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of the Year, having by God's goodneſs now lived over the <hi>Coldeſt</hi> and <hi>Hotteſt,</hi> that the <hi>Oldeſt Liver</hi> in the <hi>Province</hi> can remember, I can ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Underſtanding. 1ſt, Of the <hi>Fall,</hi> for then I came in: I found it from the 24th of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> as we have it uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> or rather like an <hi>Engliſh mild Spring.</hi> From <hi>December</hi> to the beginning of the Month called <hi>March,</hi> we had <hi>ſharp Froſty Weather;</hi> not foul, thick black Weather, as our <hi>North-Eaſt Winds</hi> bring with them in <hi>England;</hi> but a Skie as clear as in <hi>Summer,</hi> and the Air dry, cold, piercing and hungry; yet I remember not, that I wore more <hi>Clothes</hi> than in <hi>England.</hi> The reaſon of this <hi>Cold</hi> is given

from the great <hi>Lakes</hi> that are fed by the <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Canada.</hi> The Winter before was as mild, ſcarce any <hi>Ice</hi> at all; while this for a <hi>few days Froze</hi> up our great River <hi>Delaware.</hi> From that Month to the Month called <hi>June,</hi> we enjoy'd a <hi>ſweet Spring,</hi> no <hi>Guſts,</hi> but gentle <hi>Showers</hi> and a fine Skie. Yet this I obſerve, that the <hi>Winds</hi> here as there, are moſt Inconſtant <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall,</hi> upon that turn of Nature, than in <hi>Summer</hi> or <hi>Winter.</hi> From thence to this preſent Month, which ended the <hi>Summer</hi> (commonly ſpeaking) we have had <hi>extraordinary Heats</hi> yet mitigated ſometimes by <hi>Cool Breezes.</hi> The <hi>Wind</hi> that ruleth the <hi>Summer ſeaſon,</hi> is the <hi>South-Weſt;</hi> but <hi>Spring, Fall</hi> and <hi>Winter,</hi> 'tis rare to want the <hi>wholeſome North Weſtern</hi> ſeven dayes together: And whatever <hi>Miſts, Fogs</hi> or <hi>Vapours</hi> ſoul the Heavens by <hi>Eaſterly</hi> or <hi>Southerly Winds,</hi> in two Hours time are blown away; the <hi>one</hi> is alwayes followed by the <hi>other.</hi> A Remedy that ſeems to have a peculiar Providence in it to the Inhabitants; the multitude of <hi>Trees</hi> yet ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being liable to retain <hi>Miſts</hi> and <hi>Vapours,</hi> and yet not one quarter ſo <hi>think</hi> as I expected.</p>

But to reſolve the doubt, I intend, if God give me Life, to try <hi>both,</hi> and hope the conſequence will be as good <hi>Wine</hi> as any <hi>European</hi> Countries of the ſame Latitude do yield.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Artificial Produce</hi> of the Country, is <hi>Wheat, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Oats, Rye, Peaſe, Beanes, Squaſhes, Pumkins, Water-Melons, Musk-Melons,</hi> and all Herbs and Roots that our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens in <hi>England</hi> uſually bring forth.</p>

               <p>They believe, that after this Life, the Soul ſhall be diſpoſed of according to its works here, either to the habitacle of the Gods to enjoy perpetual happineſs, or to a great pit or hole in the furtheſt part of their Countrey toward Sunſet, (which they think the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt part of the World) there to be burnt continually.

               <p>This <hi>Powhatan</hi> had about thirty Kings under him, his Treaſure conſiſted of Skins, Copper, Pearls, Beads, and the like, kept in a houſe on purpoſe againſt the time of his Burial; this Houſe was fifty or ſixty Yards long, frequented only by Prieſts, at the four Corners ſtood four Images as Centinels, one of a Bear, another a Dragon, a third a Leopard, and the fourth a Giant; he hath as many Women as he pleaſe, whom when he is weary of, he beſtows upon his Favourites; his Will and the Cuſtoms of the Countrey are his Laws, Malefactors are puniſhed, by broiling to death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with Fire, and divers other Tortures; Mr. <hi>White</hi> relates, that about ten Mile from <hi>James</hi>-Town,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57816:70"/>
one of their Kings made a Feaſt in the Woods, the People were monſtrouſly painted, ſome like black Devils, with Horns, and their Hair looſe of divers Colours, they continued two days dancing in a circle of a Quarter of a Mile about, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in a rank, in two Companies, uſing ſeveral Antick Tricks, the King leading the dance; all in the midſt had black Horns on their Heads, and Green Boughs in their Hands, next whom were four or five Principal Men differently painted, who with Clubs beat thoſe forward that tired in the Dance, which held ſo long that they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able to go nor ſtand; they made a helliſh noiſe, and every one throwing away his Bough, ran clapping their Hands up into a Tree, and tearing down a Branch fell into their Order again. After this fifteen of their propereſt Boys between ten and fifteen years old, painted white, were brought forth to the People, who ſpent the Forenoon in dancing and finging about them with rattles; Then the Children were fetched away, the Women weeping and paſſionately crying out, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Moſs Skins, Matts and dry Wood, making Wreaths for their Heads, and decking their Hair with Leaves, after which they were all caſt on an heap in a Valley as dead, where a great Feaſt was made for all the Company for two Hours, they then fell again into a Circle and danced about the Youths, cauſing a Fire to be made upon an Altar, which our Men thought was deſigned to Sacrifice them to the Devil, but it was a miſtake, and the <hi>Indians</hi> deluded our Men by falſe Stories, one denying and another affirming the ſame thing, being either ignorant or unwilling to diſcover the deviliſh Myſteries of their Religion; but Captain <hi>Smith</hi> ſays, that a King being demanded the meaning of this Sacrifice, anſwered, <hi>that the Children were not all dead, but that</hi> Okee <hi>or the Devil, did ſuck the Blood from their left Breaſt, till ſome of them died, but the reſt were kept in the Wilderneſs till nine Moons were expired, during which they muſt not converſe with any, and of theſe were made Prieſts and Conjurers.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:57816:70"/>They think theſe Sacrifices ſo neceſſary, that if omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they believe their <hi>Okee</hi> or Devil, and their other Gods would hinder them from having any Deer, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies, Corn or Fiſh, and would likewiſe make a great Slaughter among them. They imagin their Prieſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death go beyond the Mountains toward the Sun-ſetting, and remain there continually in the ſhape of their <hi>Okee,</hi> having their Heads painted with Oil, and finely trimmed with Feathers, being furniſhed with Beads, Hatchets, Copper and Tobacco, never ceaſing to dance and ſing with their Predeceſſors, yet they ſuppoſe the Common People ſhall dye like Beaſts, and never live after death; ſome of their Prieſts were ſo far convinced, that they declared they believed, our God exceeded theirs, as much as our Guns did their Bows and Arrows, and ſent many Preſents to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, intreating him to pray to his God for Rain, for their God would not ſend them any. By break of day before they eat or drink, the Men, Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren above ten years old run into the Water, and there waſh a good ſpace till the Sun ariſe, then they offer Sacrifice to it, ſtrewing Tobacco on the Land and Water, repeating the ſame Ceremonies at Sun ſet; <hi>George Caſſon</hi> aforementioned was Sacrificed, as they thought, to the Devil, being ſtript naked and bound to two Stakes with his back againſt a great Fire, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they ript up his Belly and burnt his Bowels, drying his Fleſh to the Bones, which they kept above ground in a by Room; many other <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were cruelly and treacherouſly Executed by them, though perhaps not Sacrificed, and none had eſcaped if their Ambuſhes had ſucceeded. <hi>Powhatan</hi> invited one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Ratcliff</hi> and thirty others to Trade for Corn, and having brought them within his Ambuſh, Murdered them all.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Tomocomo</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> and Counſellor to one of their Kings, came into <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, who landing in the Weſt was much ſurprized at our plenty of Corn and Trees, imagining
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57816:71"/>
we ventured into their Countrey to ſupply thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, he began then to number the Men he met with, but his Arithmetick ſoon failed him; he related that <hi>Okee</hi> their God did often appear to him in his Temple, to which purpoſe four of their Prieſts go into the Houſe, and uſing certain ſtrange words and geſtures, eight more are called in, to whom he diſcovers what his will is; upon him they depend in all their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as in taking Journeys or the like; ſometimes when they reſolve to go on hunting, he by ſome known token will direct where they ſhall find Game, which they with great cheerfulneſs acknowledging, follow his directions, and many times ſucceed therein; he appears like a handſom <hi>Indian</hi> with long black Locks of Hair, after he hath ſtaid with his twelve Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates for ſome time, he aſcendeth into the Air from whence he came. The Natives think it a diſgrace to fear death, and therefore when they muſt dye, they do it reſolutely, as it happened to one who robbed an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and was by <hi>Powhatan</hi> (vpon complaint made againſt him,) fetched ſixty Miles from the place where he lay concealed, and by this <hi>Tomocomo</hi> Execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the preſence of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> his Brains being knockt out, without the leaſt ſhew of fear or terrour.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Virginians</hi> are not born ſo ſwarthy as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, their hair is generally black, few men have beards, becauſe they pluck out the hair that would grow, their Ointments and ſmoaky houſes do in a great meaſure cauſe their blackneſs, whereby they look like Bacon, they have one wife, many Concubines, and are likewiſe Sodomites; The Ancient Women are uſed for Cooks, Barbers, and other ſervices, the younger for dalliance, they are modeſt in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and ſeldom quarrel, in entertaining a ſtranger they ſpread a Matt for him to ſit down, and then dance before him, they wear their nails long to flea their Deer, and put Bows and Arrows into the Hands of their Children, before they are ſix years old. In each Ear they have generally three great holes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

they commonly hang chains, bracelets, or Copper, ſome wear a Snake therein coloured green and yellow near half a yard long, which crawling about their necks offers to kiſs their lips, others have a dead Rat tyed by the Tail. The Women raze their bodies, legs and thighs with an Iron in curious knots, and Shapes of Fowles, Fiſhes, &amp; Beaſts, and Rub a painting therein which will never come out; The Queen of <hi>Apametica</hi> was attired with a Coronet beſet with many white Bones; with Copper in her ears, and a Chain of the ſame ſix times incompaſſing her neck; The <hi>Saſquehanocks</hi> are Giant-like people, very monſtrous in proportion, behaviour and attire, their voice ſounds as if out of a Cave, their Garments are Bears-Skins, hanged with Bears Paws, a Wolfes head, and ſuch odd Jewels; their Tobacco Pipes, three quarters of a yard long with the head of ſome beaſt at the end ſo weighty as to beat out the brains of a Horſe. The calf of one of their legs was mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured three quarters of a yard about, their other limbs being proportionable. They have divers ridiculous conceits concerning their Original, as that a Hare came into their Countrey, and made the firſt men and after preſerved them from a great Serpent, and two other Hares coming thither, the firſt killed a Deer for their entertainment, which was then the only Deer in the World, and ſtrewing the hairs of that Deers hide, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Hair proved a Deer.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Carolina</hi> was in the Year 1663.

And the ſaid Lords Proprietors have there ſetled a Conſtitution of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whereby is granted Liberty of Conſcience, and wherein all poſſible care is taken for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Adminiſtration of Juſtice, and for the laſting Security of the Inhabitants both in their Perſons and Eſtates.</p>
               <p>By the care and endeavours of the ſaid Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, and at their very great charge, two Colonies have been ſetled in this <hi>Province,</hi> the one at <hi>Albemarle</hi> in the moſt Northerly part, the other at <hi>Aſhly</hi> River, which is in the Latitude of thirty two Degrees od Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albemarle</hi> bordering upon <hi>Virginia,</hi> and only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it in Health, Fertility, and Mildneſs of the Winter, is in the Growths, Productions, and other things much of the ſame nature with it: Wherefore I ſhall not trouble the Reader with a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that part; but apply my ſelf principally to diſcourſe of the Colony at <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> which being many Degrees more Southward than <hi>Virginia,</hi> differs
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57816:73"/>
much from it in the Nature of its Climate and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſhly-River</hi> was firſt ſetled in <hi>April</hi> 1670. the Lords Proprietors having at their ſole charge, ſet out three Veſſels, with a conſiderable number of able Men, eighteen Moneths Victuals, with Clothes, Tools, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and what elſe was thought neceſſary for a new Settlement, and continued at this charge to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Colony for divers years after, until the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were able by their own Induſtry to live of themſelves; in which condition they have been for divers years paſt, and are arrived to a very great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Plenty of all ſorts of Proviſions. Inſomuch, that moſt ſorts are already cheaper there, than in any other of the Engliſh Colonys, and they are plentifully enough ſupplied with all things from <hi>England</hi> or other Parts. <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> about ſeven Miles in from the Sea, divides it ſelf into two Branches; the Southermoſt retaining the name of <hi>Aſhly-River,</hi> the North Branch is called <hi>Cooper-River.</hi> In <hi>May,</hi> 1680. the Lords Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors ſent their Orders to the Government their, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Port-Town for theſe two Rivers to be Built on the Point of Land that divides them, and to be called <hi>Charles</hi> Town, ſince which time about an hundred Houſes are there Built, and more are Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily by the Perſons of all ſorts that come there to Inhabit, from the more Northern Engliſh Colonys, and the Sugar Iſlands, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and many Perſons who went to <hi>Carolina</hi> Servants, being Induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, ſince they came out of their times with their Maſters, at whoſe charge they were Tranſported, have gotten good Stocks of Cattle, and Servants of their own; have here alſo Built Houſes, and exerciſe their Trades: And many that went thither in that condition, are now worth ſeveral Hundreds of Pounds, and live in a very plentiful condition, and their Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſtill encreaſing. And Land is become of that value near the Town, that it is ſold for twenty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Acre, though pillaged of all its valuable Timber, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57816:74"/>
not cleared of the reſt, and Land that is clear'd and fitted for Planting, and Fenced, is let for ten Shillings <hi>per annum</hi> the Acre, though twenty miles diſtant from the Town, and ſix men will in ſix weeks time, Fall, Clear, Fence in, and fit for Planting, ſix Acres of Land. At this Town in <hi>November,</hi> 1680. There Rode at one time ſixteen Sail of Veſſels (ſome of which were upwards of 200 Tuns) that came from divers parts of the Kings Dominions to trade there, which great concourſe of ſhipping, will undoubtebly in a ſhort time make it a conſiderable Town.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eaſtern Shore of America,</hi> whether it be by reaſon of its having the great Body of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the Weſtward of it, and by conſequence the Northweſt-Wind (which blows contrary to the Sun) the Freezing-Wind, as the North-Eaſt is in <hi>Europe,</hi> or that the Frozen Lakes which lie-in, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yond <hi>Canada,</hi> and lie <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> from the Shore, Impregnate the Freezing Wind with more chill and congealing qualities, or that the uncultivated Earth, covered for the moſt part with large ſhading Trees, breathes forth more nitrous Vapours, than that which is cultivated; or all theſe Reaſons together, it is certainly much more cold than any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> in the ſame Degree of Latitude, inſomuch that <hi>New-England</hi> and thoſe parts of <hi>America</hi> about the Latitude of thirty nine and forty, and more <hi>North,</hi> though above ſix hundred miles nearer the Sun than <hi>England;</hi> is notwithſtanding many degrees colder in the <hi>Winter.</hi>

They have no Letters, yet ſupply that defect either by Counters, Emblems or Hieroglyphicks, or elſe by Tradition delivered in long Tales from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son, which when children they are taught to ſay by rote; where a battel has been fought they raiſe a ſmall Pyramid of ſtones conſiſting of the number of the ſlain and Priſoners taken; By the picture of a <hi>Stag</hi> they expreſs <hi>Swiftneſs;</hi> By a <hi>Serpent, wrath;</hi> By a <hi>Lion, Courage;</hi> By a <hi>Dog, Faithfulneſs;</hi> By a <hi>Swan</hi> they ſignify the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> alluding to their white Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and flight over the Sea; They worſhip one God the Creator of all things whom they call <hi>Okee,</hi> and to whom the High Prieſt offers Sacrifice, yet they

believe he has no care of worldly affairs, but commits the Government of Mankind to good and Evil Spirits, to whom the Inferior Prieſts pay their Devotion and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, at which in a lamentable Tune they recite the great things done by their Anceſtors. They religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve Marriage, and diſtinguiſh themſelves into four Tribes, believing that all mankind were derived from four women, whereupon they divide their places of Buriall into four Quarters, aſſigning one to every Tribe, for they hold it wicked and ominous to mingle their bodys even when dead; they commonly wrap up the Corps in the ſkins of Beaſts and bury proviſion and houſeholdſtuff for its uſe in the other world; when their Great men die they kill ſome Priſoners of War to attend them, they believe the Tranſmigration of Souls, for the <hi>Angry</hi> they ſay are poſſeſt with the Spirit of a <hi>Serpent;</hi> the <hi>Bloudy,</hi> that of a <hi>Wolf;</hi> the <hi>Fearful,</hi> of a <hi>Deer;</hi> and the <hi>Faithful</hi> of a <hi>Dog,</hi> The Reſidue of their leſſer Gods they place beyond the Mountains and the <hi>Indian</hi> Ocean, and though they want thoſe helps of Education which we have, yet in ſolemn debates they will deliver themſelves with excellent Judgment and Eloquence.</p>
               <p>This Author relates that in his Travels with ſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> they met with a Rattleſnake, in length two yards and an half and as big as a mans arm, which by the greatneſs of her Belly they judged to be full with young, but having killed and opened her, found there a ſmall Squirrel whole; The <hi>Indians</hi> aſſured him that theſe Serpents lying under a Tree fix their Eyes ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly upon the Squirrel, which ſo affrights the little Beaſt that he tumbles into the Jaws of his Enemy; Travelling through the Woods a Deer ſeized by a wild-Cat croſſed their way, being almoſt ſpent with the burden and cruelty of her Rider, who having faſtned on her Shoulder left not ſucking her Blood till ſhe fell down under him; which an <hi>Indian</hi> perceiving, ſhot a lucky Arrow which peircing the wild Cat under the Belly made him leave his prey already ſlain, and turn
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57816:78"/>
toward them with a dreadful fierce look, but his ſtrength and Spirits failing, they eſcaped his revenge which they had certainly felt had not his wound been mortal. This Creature is ſomewhat bigger than our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Fox, of a reddiſh grey Colour, and in figure eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way like an ordinary Cat, fierce, ravenous and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for knowing the Deer, (upon which they chiefly prey) too ſwift for them, they watch upon Branches of Trees, and as they walk or feed under, jump down upon them; The Fur is counted excellent, and the Fleſh eaten by the <hi>Indians,</hi> though as rank as a Dogs. They ſaw great Herds of Red and Fallow Deer daily feeding, and on the ſides of the Hills Bears craſhing Maſts like Swine; Small Leopards they ſaw, but never any Lions, though their Skins are much worn by the <hi>Indians;</hi> The Wolves were ſo ravenous, that they often feared their Horſes would have been devoured, in the night they gathered up and howled ſo cloſe about them, if the Fires they made had not ſcar'd them away; The Woods were full of Bever, O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In a ſecond Expedition, he came to another ſort of <hi>Indians,</hi> enemies to the Chriſtians, yet ventured among them becauſe they hurt none whom they do not fear, and after he had given them ſome ſin all Trifles of Glaſs and Metal they were very kind to him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with their Gods, whether to admit him into their Nation and Councils, and oblige him to ſtay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them by a Marriage with their Kings or ſome

of their great Mens daughters, but he with much ado waved their courteſies and got leave to depart upon promiſe to return in ſix Months. At length he came to a Town more populous than any he had ſeen before in his Journey; The King whereof though his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are large and populous is in continual fear of his Neighbour <hi>Indians,</hi> who are a People ſo addicted to Arms that even their Women come into the Field, and ſhoot Arrows over their Husbands Shoulders. The men it ſeems fight with Silver hatchets, for an <hi>Indian</hi> told him, they were of the ſame metal with the hilt of his Sword. They are a cruel Nation and ſteal their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Children to ſacrifice them to their Idols: The Women delight much in Ornaments of Feathers of which they have great Variety, but Peacocks are moſt in eſteem becauſe not common in that Countrey; They are reaſonably handſom and more civil in their Carriage than their Neighbours, but miſerably infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated with the Illuſions of the Devil, it cauſed no ſmall horror in him to ſee one of them, with his neck all one ſide, foam at the mouth, ſtand barefoot upon burnings Coals for neer an hour, and then, recovering his ſenſes, leap out of the fire without hurt or ſ gn of any; this he was an Eye witneſs of. Southweſt from hence he arrived at a Nation who differ in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all the other <hi>Indians</hi> of theſe parts, being ſlaves rather than Subjects to their King; their Monarch was a grave man, and courteous to Strangers, yet our Authour could not without horror obſerve his Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Superſtition, in hiring 3 Youths to kill as many young Women of their Enemies, as they could meet withal to ſerve his Son, then newly dead in the other World as he vainly imagined. Theſe youths during his ſtay returned with Skins torn off the Heads and Faces of three young Girls which they preſented to their King and were by him gratefully received. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in his ſleep was ſtung by a Mountain Spider, and had not an <hi>Indian</hi> ſuckt out the Poyſon he had died for receiving the hurt at the rip of one of his Fingers,

                  <hi>ANguilla,</hi> ſometimes called <hi>Snake</hi> Iſland from its Shape, is a long Tract of Land of about Thirty mile, and nine mile broad, winding almoſt about neer, St. <hi>Martins</hi> Iſland, whence it is very plainly perceived; There is not any Mountain in it, the ground lying low and even; Where it is broadeſt there is a Pond, about which ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſetled themſelves in number two or three hundred, and where they plant Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, which is highly eſteemed by thoſe who are good Judges in that Commodity. The Iſland lyes in Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Degrees and Twenty Minutes on this ſide the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial. Before the diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> there were not to be found in theſe parts any Horſes, Kine, Oxen, Sheep, Goats, Swine, or Dogs, but for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conveniency of their Navigations and ſupply of their Ships in caſe of neceſſity they left ſome of theſe Creatures in ſeveral parts of this <hi>New-found World,</hi> where they have ſince multiplyed ſo exceedingly, that now they are more common, as well on the Continent as the <hi>Caribees,</hi> than in any part of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſide theſe Foreign kinds of Cattle, there were before in theſe Iſlands certain ſorts of ſtrange fourfoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beaſts, as the <hi>Opaſſum</hi> about the bigneſs of a Cat with a Sharp Snout, the neither Jaw being ſhorter than the upper like a Pigs, it hath very ſharp Claws, and climbs Trees eaſily, feeding upon Birds, and in want thereof upon fruit, it is Remarkable for a purſe or bag of its own Skin folded together under its belly,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57816:85"/>
wherein it carries its young, which it lays upon the ground at pleaſure by opening that natural purſe, when he would leave that place he opens it again, and the young ones get in, and ſo he carries them with him wherever he goes. The female ſuckles them without ſetting them on the ground, for her Teats lye within that Purſe, which is much ſofter within that without; The Female commonly brings ſix young ones, but the Male who hath ſuch another natural Purſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Belly, carries them in his turn to eaſe the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</p>

               <p>But of all, the <hi>Caymaa, Crocodile</hi> or Allegator is very remarkable it keeps neer the Sea and in Rivers and Iſlands uninhabited, and ſometimes among the Reeds on Land, very hideous to look on. It is thought to live very long, and grows bigger to the very laſt day, even to eighteen foot long and as big about as an Hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, it hath four feet well armed with crooked Claws; The ſkin, which is covered all over with ſcales, is ſo hard on the back that a Bullet from a Musket ſhot at him ſhall hardly make any Impreſſion on it, but if be hurt under the belly, or in the eyes he is ſoon gone; his lower Jaw is immoveable, but hath ſo wide a mouth, and ſo well ſet with ſharp Teeth that he makes nothing to cut a man in two; He runs faſt enough on the Land, but the weight of his body makes as deep a Track in the ſand as a Coach-horſe, and having no joints in the backbone, he goes ſtreight forward, not being able to turn his vaſt body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty, ſo that to avoid him one need only turn aſide ſeveral times. Thoſe that are bred in the freſh-water ſmell of Muſk, while they are alive,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57816:87"/>
and the Air is perfumed an hundred paces about them, nay the water retains ſomewhat of the ſmell, which is incloſed in certain Glandules under his Thighs, and being taken thence retain their ſcent long; It may be Providence hath beſtowed it upon them, that men and other Creatures may avoid being made a Prey to theſe cruel Monſters.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that live in the Sea have no ſuch ſmell, but both kinds are very dangerous to thoſe that ſwim; They have a cunning ſlight for ſeizing Oxen and Cows, for one of them will lye lurking at the places where they come to Water, and finding one at his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he half ſhuts his eyes, and floats on the top of the Water like a peice of rotten wood, and getting ſtill nearer to the poor Beaſt which is drinking and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware of him, he immediately faſtens on him by the lips, forcing him under Water, drowning and then eating him. He likewiſe takes men by the ſame ſleight, for <hi>Vincent Le Blanc</hi> relates, that the Servant of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul of <hi>Alexandria</hi> going to take up one of theſe cruel Creatures, thinking it had been a peice of wood, was drawn by it to the bottom of the River, and never ſeen more. There are abundance of theſe Monſtrous <hi>Crocodiles</hi> in theſe Iſlands who come in great numbers in the night to the places where the <hi>Tortoiſes</hi> are killed (of which hereafter) to feed on the entrails and carcaſs of them that are left by Fiſhermen; who are obliged to carry great wooden Leavers with them to keep off theſe <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> and oftimes kill them by firſt breaking their back therewith. Several parts of this Ravenous Monſter are accounted good for many Diſeaſes, the wiſe Author of Nature having provided ſome advant ges from thoſe Creatures which are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe moſt pernicious.</p>

               <p>THe Iſland of <hi>Montſerrat</hi> received that Title of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from the reſemblance of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain therein to that of <hi>Montſerrat</hi> neer <hi>Barcelona</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and hath retained the name ever ſince; It is of a ſmall extent, not above three Leagues or nine Miles in length, and neer as much in bredth, ſo that it ſeems almoſt round. It lies in the Latitude of ſeventeen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees on this ſide the Line, full of mountains whereon grow plenty of <hi>Cedar</hi> and other Trees: The Valleys and plains being very fertile. It is chiefly inhabited by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> with ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in all about ſix or ſeaven hundred perſons; There is in it a very fair Church of a delightful ſtructure, built by the contributions of the Governor and Inhabitants: The Pulpit, Seats, and all the Joyners and Carpenters work within it are of the moſt precious and ſweet-ſcented wood growing in the Countrey.</p>
               <p>On the Coaſts of theſe Iſlands there is ſometimes taken by the Fiſhers a Monſter ſo dreadful that they call it the <hi>Sea-Devil</hi> about four foot long and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably big, it hath on the back a great bunch full of Prickles like an Hedghog; The Skin thereof is hard, uneven and rugged like that of a Sea-dog and of a black colour, the head is flat and on the upper part hath many little riſings, and among them two ſmall very black eyes. The mouth is extream wide, with ſeveral very ſharp Teeth, two of them crooked like a Wild Boars, it hath four Fins and a broad forked Tail; but has the name of <hi>Sea-Devil,</hi> becauſe above the eyes there
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57816:88"/>
are two little ſharp black Horns, which turn toward his back like a Rams; As this Monſter is extream ugly, the Meat of it, which is ſoft and full of ſtrings, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Poyſon, cauſing ſtrange Vomitings and Swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which prove mortal if not prevented by a good Doſe of <hi>Mithridate</hi> or ſome other Antidote, this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Creature is only deſired by the curious to adorn their Cloſets, whereby it happens that this Devil who was never profitable while alive, gives a little ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Eyes after death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sea <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> is a Fiſh no leſs Miraculous, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious one, being caſt aſhore about theſe Iſlands, is thus deſcribed by an Ingenious occular Witneſs; This Unicorn, ſaith he, was purſuing a ſmaller Fiſh with ſuch earneſtneſs and impetuoſity, that it ſtuck with half the body dry on a Sand-bank, and before it could recover the deep, was deſtroyed by the Inhabitants; It was about eighteen Foot long, and in compaſs as big as a Barrel, having ſix great Fins like the ends of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Oars, whereof two were placed near the Gills, and the other four at the ſides of the Belly at equal diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they were of a Vermillion red Colour; All the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Body was covered with great Scales a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bigneſs of a Crown peice, of a blew Colour, intermixt with Spangles of Silver, near the Neck the Scales were cloſer, and of a dark Colour like a Collar; The Scales under the Belly were yellow, the Tail Forked, the Head ſomewhat bigger than that of a Horſe, and near the ſame ſhape; The lower part of the Body was covered with an hard dark Skin, and as, it is ſaid, the <hi>Land <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> hath one Horn in his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, ſo this <hi>Sea <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi> had a very fair one iſſuing out of his Head about nine Foot and an half in length, it was very ſtreight, and grew ſmaller to the very point, which was ſharp enough to peirce Wood, Stone, or any thing more hard: Toward the Head it was ſixteen Inches about, and from thence almoſt to the end wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a wreathed Pillar, growing ſmaller till they gently ended in a point, it was naturally poliſhed of a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57816:88"/>
ſhining black, marked with certain ſmall white and yellow ſtrokes, and of ſuch ſolidity, that a ſharp File could hardly get a little ſmall Powder from it. It had no Ears ſtanding up, but two ſpacious Gills as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fiſhes. The Eyes are about the bigneſs of an Hens Egg, the Ball which was of a Skie Colour, Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meld with yellow, was of Vermillion Colour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it another as clear as Chryſtal; The Mouth was wide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ough, with ſeveral extream ſharp Teeth; The Tongue proportionable, covered with a rough red Skin; Upon the Head was a Crown riſing two Inches above the Skin, made Oval, and ending in a point. Above three hundred Perſons eat of the Meat of it, and thought it exceeding delicate, being Inter-larded with white fat, and when Boiled, came up in Fleaks like freſh Cod, but of a more excellent taſt; Thoſe who ſaw it alive, and broke its back with Leavers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that he made prodigious attempts to thruſt them with his Horn, uſing it with much nimbleneſs and dexterity, and if he had not wanted Water, would have been too hard for them all, within him they found the ſcales of ſeveral Fiſhes, a token that he lived by prey.</p>
               <p>Of all the Sea-Monſters that are good to eat, and kept for Proviſion as Salmon and Cod are in <hi>Europe</hi> the moſt eſteemed in theſe Iſlands is a certain Fiſh by the <hi>French</hi> called <hi>Lamantine</hi> and <hi>Manaty;</hi> It is a Monſter that in time grows to that bulk that ſome of them are eighteen foot in length and ſeven in bigneſs, the head is like a Cow, and from thence termed by ſome the <hi>Sea-Cow,</hi> with ſmall Eyes and a thick Skin of a dark colour wrinkled and hairy, which being dryed ſerves for a Buckler againſt the Arrows of the <hi>Indians.</hi> They have no Fins, but inſtead thereof two ſhort feet under their Bellies, each of which hath four fingers, very weak to ſupport the weight of ſo heavy a Body, nor hath he any other defenſive weapons; It lives on the graſs and Herbage about the Rocks, in thoſe Shallow places that have not much above a fathom of Sea-Water. The
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57816:89"/>
Females are diſburthened of their young like Cows; and have two Teats wherewith they ſuckle them, they bring forth two at a time, who forſake not the old one till they no longer need Milk, and can feed on Graſs as ſhe does. Of all Fiſh none are ſo good meat as this, two or three will load a great Canow, and eat ſhort like a Land creature, of a Vermilion colour, not cloying or fulſom, and mixt with fat, which being mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted never grows muſty: It is much more wholſom ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a day or two than freſh; Certain ſmall ſtones found in his head are highly valued for the Stone and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel when diſſolved to Powder.</p>
               <p>There are often ſeen riſing out of the Sea about theſe Iſlands great numbers of Fiſhes which fly fifteen or twenty foot above Water, and neer an hundred paces in Length, but no more in regard their Wings are dried by the Sun, they are ſomewhat like <hi>Herrings</hi> but of a rounder head and broader back, their wings like a Bats, which begin a little below the head, and reach almoſt to the Tail. In their flight they many times ſtrike againſt the Sails of Ships, and fall even in the day time upon the Decks, ſome ſay they are very good meat; the cauſe of their flying is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void danger from greater Fiſhes but they meet with Enemies in the Air as well as Water, for certain Sea-Fowl which live only by Prey have open hoſtility with them and ſeize them as they fly. The <hi>Sword-Fiſh</hi> is worth obſerving as well as the <hi>Flying-Fiſh,</hi> it hath at the end of the upper Jaw a defenſive weapon about the bredth of a great broad Sword, which hath Sharp hard teeth on both ſides, ſome of theſe Swords are five foot long, and ſix inches broad at the lower end with twenty ſeaven white ſolid teeth in each rank, and the bulk of their Bodies bears a proportion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The head of this Monſter is flat and hideous to behold, being in the Shape of an Heart, neer their Eyes they have two Vents at which they caſt out the Water which they have ſwallowed; They have no Scales but a greyiſh Skin on their back, and white
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57816:89"/>
under the belly which is rough like a file; They have ſeaven Fins, two of each ſide, two on the back, and and one which ſerves them for a Tail, ſome call them <hi>Saw-fiſhes,</hi> and ſome <hi>Emperors,</hi> becauſe there is always open War between them and the Whale, which is many times wounded to death by this their dreadful weapon.</p>

On the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Iſle is a very convenient Harbour for Ships. It is very Mountainous in the midſt which incompaſſes an inacceſſible bottom, where from the tops of certain Rocks may be ſeen an infinite number of Vipers, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and other dreadful venemous Creatures, whom none dares approach unto. Yet there are many fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful valleys producing ſeveral commodities, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Tobacco which is planted by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but the Natives who are <hi>Cannibals</hi> and very barbarous do much hinder the coming of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſettle there: For the <hi>Caribeans</hi> are very numerous in it, and have a long time entertained thoſe who came to viſit them with a ſtory of a vaſt and monſtrous Serpent which had its aboad in that bottom, affirming that there was on the head of it a very ſparkling ſtone like a Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of ineſtimable price, and that it commonly covered this Rich Jewel with a thin moving Skin like that of a mans Eye-lid, but that when it went to drink or ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57816:90"/>
it ſelf within the midſt of that deep bottom he fully diſcovered it, and that the Rocks &amp; all about received a a wonderful luſtre from the Fire iſſuing out of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Crown.</p>
               <p>The Supream Perſon of this Iſland was heretofore one of the moſt conſiderable among thoſe of the ſame Nation, for when all their forces marched out againſt the <hi>Arovagues</hi> their Common Enemies of the Continent, he had ſtill the conduct of the Van-guard, and was known by a particular Mark which he had about him; When any <hi>French</hi> ſhips come neer this Iſland there are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſeen ſeveral Canows in each of which there are are three or four <hi>Indians</hi> at the moſt who come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them to the Havens where they may ſafely An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor. They commonly bring along with them ſome of the Countrey fruits, whereof having preſented the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and other Officers with the choiceſt, they offer the reſt in exchange for Fiſhing hooks, graines of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal and ſuch trifles as they Account precious. They have had ſome differences with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the account of damage received from ſome particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which though our nation hath proteſted againſt, yet their reveng is ſo implacable that they hardly ever forgive nor paſs by any injuries; And upon this Account next the <hi>Arovages</hi> on the Continent of <hi>America</hi> the greateſt enemies the <hi>Caeibbeans</hi> have are the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> which enmity took his riſe from hence, that ſome ill principled <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> under the Flags of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions having by pretended kindneſs, and little gifts and <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> which they dearly love, got divers of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ribbeans</hi> aboard their Ships, when they ſaw their Veſſel ful of theſe poor people who never dreamt of ſuch Treachery, carried away men, Women and Children into their Plantations, were they are ſtill kept ſlaves.</p>
               <p>Hence it happens they bear ſuch a grudg to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> as hardly to endure to hear their Language, and if a <hi>Frenchman</hi> or ſome other Nation in Friendſhip with them chance to uſe any <hi>Engliſh</hi> expreſſion he runs the hazard of their Enmity. In revenge hereof they oft
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57816:90"/>
make Incurſions into <hi>Montſerrat, Antego</hi> and other <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Settlements, firing their Houſes, and carrying a way Goods, Men, Women, and Children with them, but do not eat them as they do the <hi>Arovagues.</hi> They do not love to be called <hi>Cannibals</hi> though they eat the Fleſh of their Enemies, which they ſay they do to ſatisfy their Indignation and revenge, and not out of any delicacy they find in it more than in any thing elſe which they eat; In other things they are of a good tractable diſpoſition, and ſo great enemies to ſeverity that if the <hi>European</hi> or other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who have any of them ſlaves, treat them with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, they dye out of pure grief.

When they go a hunting, Fiſhing, or root up Trees for ground to make a little Garden, or to build Houſes, which are innocent Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſutable to the nature of man, they do all without eagerneſs and as it were in a way of divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Recreation.</p>

               <p>They are great enemies to thieving and live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtruſt of each other, their Houſes and Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being left without keepers, but if the leaſt thing be taken from them, ſuch as a little knife wherewith they do ſtrange things in Joyners work, they ſo highly prize its uſefulneſs, that ſuch a loſs is enough to make them weep and grieve a week after, nay ingages them to join with their friends and demand reparations, and to be revenged on the Perſon, eſpecially where the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57816:91"/>
Chriſtians live neer them, for then upon miſſing a y thing they preſently cry, <hi>Some Chriſtian has been here;</hi> And among the Grievances and Complaints which they make to the Governours of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, this comes always in the Front, <hi>Compere Governour, thy Mariners</hi> (for ſo they call all Forreigners) <hi>have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a knife out of my Cottage,</hi> or ſome ſuch ſmall houſhold-ſtuff; They are a people aſſociated in one common Intereſt and extream loving to each other, from whence there are few Quarrels or Animoſities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but if they are once injured either by a ſtranger or their own Countreymen they never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, but contrive all ways to be revenged; Thus when their Sorcerers or Conjurers tell them, any one hath done them the miſchief which happens to them, they endeavour all they can to kill him, ſaying, <hi>He hath bewitched me, I will be revenged on him;</hi> And this furious paſſion and deſire of Revenge is that which makes them ſo brutiſh as to eat the very fleſh of their enemies. This implacable Animoſity is a Vice generally Reigning among them, and exerciſes the ſame Tyranny without exception over all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of <hi>America.</hi> The revenge of the <hi>Canadians</hi> is very pleaſant, who eat their own Lice becauſe they bite them: If the <hi>Braſileans</hi> hurt themſelves againſt a ſtone, to be revenged they bite it as hard as that can, yea they bite the Arrows which light upon them in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</p>
               <p>They bear great reſpect to ancient People, hearing them ſpeak with much attention, the younger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying in all things to their Sentiments and Wills. The young men among the <hi>Caribeans</hi> have no converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either with the Maids or Married Women, and it is obſerved that the men in this Countrey are leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous than the Women, as they are in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Torrid Zone; Yet both ſexes are very chaſt, a rare quality among Savages. When thoſe of other Nations look earneſtly upon the Women, and laugh at their nakedneſs they are wont to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57816:92"/>
ſay to them. <hi>Friends you are to look on us only between both our Eyes;</hi> A virtue worthy admiration in a people that go naked and are as barbarous as theſe. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that Captain <hi>Baron</hi> a <hi>Caribean,</hi> in one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions they made upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> from whence he carried a great Booty, took among other Priſoners a young Gentlewoman wife to one of the Officers of the Iſland, whom he cauſed to be brought to one of his Houſes in <hi>Dominica,</hi> and being big with Child ſhe was carefully attended by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Women of the Iſland during her lying in, and though ſhe lived a great while among them, yet neither he nor any other ever touched her, a great example of reſervedneſs in ſuch People. Yet it muſt be acknowledged ſome of them have ſince degenerated from that and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues of their Anceſtots, the <hi>Europeans</hi> by their Unchriſtianlike Treatment and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous examples, their perfidious breach of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, rifling and burning their Houſes, and Villages, and Raviſhing and Debauching their Wives and Daughters, having taught them (to the perpetual Infamy of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> name) diſſimulation, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Treachery, perfidiouſneſs, Luxury,, and ſeveral other vices which were unknown before in theſe parts. Theſe <hi>Caribbeans</hi> are great lovers of cleanlineſs, a thing extraordinary among Savages, ſo that if one ſhould eaſe himſelf in their Gardens where their Potato's &amp; <hi>Caſſavy</hi> Roots are planted, they would preſently forſake them and not make uſe of any thing therein.</p>

               <p>THe Iſland of St. <hi>Vincent</hi> lies in ſixteen Degrees North from the Line, and is about twenty four Miles long, and eighteen broad, wherein are ſeveral high Mountains, between which are very fruitful Plains, yielding abundance of Sugar Canes, which grow naturally without Planting; It is well watred with Rivers, and hath ſeveral good Harbours and Bays for Shipping; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have here ſome Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but they are neither very conſiderable nor pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful herein, it being the moſt populous of <hi>Caribeans,</hi> of any poſſeſſed by them, who have here many Fair Villages, where they dwell pleaſantly and without any diſturbance, and though they are jealous of the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that live about them, and ſtand on their Guard, when they come to their Roads, yet they do not deny Caſſavy Bread, Water, Fruits, and other Proviſions growing in their Country to them that want them, taking in Exchange, Wedges, Hooks, and other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of Iron, which they much eſteem. Their ſimplicity is very remarkable in ſeveral things, as in admiring our Fire-Arms, but eſpecially Fire-locks, to which they ſee no Fire put as to Muſkets, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believe <hi>Maboya</hi> or the Devil ſets them on Fire; When the Moon is Eclipſed, they believe the Devil eats her, and dance all night making a noiſe with Gourds, wherein are many pebble Stones; When they ſmell any evil ſcent, they cry, <hi>Maboya or the Devil is here, let us be gone from him.</hi>

that Gunpowder was the Seed of ſome Herb, and ſowed ſome in their Gardens; They never make uſe of Salt, accounting it extreamly prejudicial to health, and when they ſee Chriſtians uſe it, cry, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, thou haſtneſt thy own death;</hi> but inſtead thereof they ſeaſon all things with <hi>American</hi> Pepper, neither do they eat Swines-Fleſh for this ſimple reaſon, leſt they ſhould have ſmall Eyes like that Beaſt, which they judge the greateſt deformity, nor Tortoiſe or Turtle, leaſt they ſhould participate of its lazyneſs and ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They have no notion of a Deity, ſo that neither Prayers, Ceremonies, Sacrifices, or any exerciſe or Aſſembly whatſoever is to be found amongſt them, but ſay the Earth is their indulgent Mother, who furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them with all things neceſſary to Life; if any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to them about God, and the Myſteries of our Religion, they hearken attentively, but in the end, anſwer as it were in jeſt; <hi>Friend, thou art very Eloquent and Subtle, I wiſh I could talk as well as thee:</hi> Nay they ſometimes ſay, <hi>That if they ſhould be perſuaded by ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, their Neighbours would laugh at them;</hi> A certain <hi>Caribean</hi> being at Work on a Sunday, Mounſieur <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Friend, he that made Heaven and Earth will he angry with thee for working on this Day, for he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this Day for his Service, and I,</hi> replyed the Savage very bluntly, <hi>am already very angry with him, for thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he is Maſter of the World and the Seaſons; He it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that hath forborn to ſend Rain in due time, and by reaſon of the great drowth, hath cauſed my</hi> Manioc, <hi>and my</hi> Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes <hi>to rot in the Ground; now ſince he hath treated me ſo ill, I will Work on every Sunday on purpoſe to vex him;</hi> A preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Example of the brutality of this wretched Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Yet have they a natural Sentiment of ſome Divinity or Superior power, that hath its reſidence in Heaven, which they ſay is contented to enjoy quietly the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of its own felicity, without being offended at the ill actions of Men, and is endued with ſo great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as not to take any revenge even of Enemies, from

whence they render Heaven, neither Honour nor Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration interpreting its liberality and long ſufferance, an effect either of its weakneſs or indifference toward Mankind; yet they believe there are a number of good and evil Spirits, the good are their Gods, and every one imagins that their is one of them particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for his conduct, yet will not acknowledge them Creators of the World, and when the Chriſtians tell them, we adore that God who made Heaven and Earth, and cauſeth the Earth to bring forth Fruits and Herbs for our nouriſhment, they anſwer; <hi>It is true thy God hath made the Heaven and the Earth of</hi> France, <hi>(or ſome other Countrey that they name) and cauſes the Wheat to grow there, but our Gods have made our Countrey, and cauſe our</hi> Manioc <hi>to grow; This</hi> Manioc <hi>is a Root of a ſmall Tree or Shrub, whereof the</hi> Caribeans <hi>make Bread.</hi> When they recover of ſome Diſeaſe, they ſet a little Table at the end of their Hutts, and upon it their offerings, but without any Adoration or Prayers, yet they invocate their falſe Gods, when they deſire his preſence, but this is done by the Prieſt, and that upon four occaſions; <hi>To demand Revenge, To be healed of Diſeaſes, To know the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of their Wars, To invocate them to drive away the great Devil or Maboya,</hi> for they never pray to him; His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation is by ſinging ſome words and burning Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, the ſcent whereof is ſo pleaſant, that it makes this little Devil appear, and when ſeveral Prieſts call upon their ſeveral Gods together, as they ſpeak, theſe Gods or rather Devils rail, quarrel, and ſeem to fight with each other; Theſe Demons ſhelter themſelves, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Bones of dead Men taken out of the Graves and wrapt in Cotton, and thereby give Oracles, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is the Soul of the Deceaſed Perſon, they make uſe of them to bewitch their Enemies, the Sorcerers wrapping up theſe Bones with ſomething that belongs to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Theſe Devils do alſo ſometimes enter into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Women, and ſpeak by them, clearly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all queſtions demanded, after the <hi>Boye</hi> or Prieſt is

Theſe poor wretches complain that ſometimes <hi>Maboya</hi> beats them ſeverely, which though ſome impute to Melancholy Dreams, yet other Perſons of Quality and exquiſite knowledge, who have long lived in St. <hi>Vinc ents</hi> Iſland, do affirm that the Devils do effectually beat them, and that they often ſhew on their Bodies the viſible marks of the blows they have received, and they ſometimes make horrid complaints of his cruelty, ſaying, <hi>That he is of late mightily incenſed againſt the</hi> Caribeans, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the <hi>Europeans</hi> happy that their <hi>Maboya</hi> does not beat them. Mounſieur <hi>Montel,</hi> who hath been oft preſent at their Aſſemblies, and converſt much with the Inhabitants of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> gives this Teſtimony upon this ſad occaſion. <hi>Notwithſtanding the ignorance and Irreligion, wherein our</hi> Caribeans <hi>live, they know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and fear more than death the Evil Spirit whom they call</hi> Maboya, <hi>for that dreadfull Enemy doth many times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them under moſt hideous ſhapes: And what is more particularly obſervable, that unmerciful and bloody Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, who is an inſatiable Murtherer from the beginning of the World, cruelly wounds and torments thoſe miſerable People, when they are not ſo forward as he would have them to engage in War, ſo that when they are reproached with Blood-Thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> their Anſwer is, <hi>they are forced thereto by</hi> Maboya <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills.</hi>

When theſe <hi>Cannibals</hi> or <hi>Eaters of men</hi> (which is here their proper names) have brought home a Priſoner of War of the <hi>Arovages,</hi> he belongs of right to him who either ſeized him in fight, or took him running away, being then brought to this Iſland, he keeps him ſafe in his houſe, and after he has made him faſt four or five daies, produces him upon ſome ſolemn day of debauch to ſerve for a publick Sacrifice to the immortal hatred of his Countreymen toward that Nation. If any of their enemies dye on the place of battel, they eat them there before they leave it, they deſign for ſlavery only the young maids and Women taken in the War. They have taſted of all the Nations that frequented them, and upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence affirm that the <hi>French</hi> are the moſt tender, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the hardeſt fleſh of digeſtion, but now, they feed on no Chriſtians at all.</p>
               <p>They abſtain from ſeveral Cruelties formerly uſed before they killed their Enemies, for whereas at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they think it enough to diſpatch them at a blow or two with a Club, and afterward cut them into peices and having boyl'd to devour them; They heretofore put them to ſeveral Torments before they gave them the mortal blow, of which they themſelves have given this deplorable relation to thoſe who have been ſo curious to inform themſelves from their own mouths; The Priſoner of War who had been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to fall into their hands, and was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that he was deſigned to receive the moſt cruel Treatment which rage could ſuggeſt, armed himſelf with conſtancy, and to expreſs how generous a Peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple the <hi>Arovages</hi> were, marched very cheerfully to the place of execution, not being either bound or drag'd thereto, and preſented himſelf with a mild and ſteady countenance in the midſt of the Aſſembly, which he knew deſired nothing ſo much as his death, and not expecting their abuſes and bitter diſcourſes, he prevented them in theſe Terms.</p>

               <p>The Great Soul of our <hi>Arovagues</hi> was not only his lips, but ſhewed it ſelf alſo in the effects which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Bravado; For after the company had a while endured his menaces and arrogant defiance without touching him, one among them came and burnt his ſides with a flaming brand, another cut great Gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets of fleſh out of him, and would cut bigger if the bones would have admitted it, then they caſt pepper into his wounds, others diverted themſelves in ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arrows at the poor Patient, and every one took a pleaſure in tormenting him, but he ſuffered with the ſame unconcerned countenance, and expreſſed not

the leaſt ſence of pain; After they had thus ſported a long time with the poor wretch, at laſt growing weary of inſulting and out-braved by his conſtancy which ſeemed ſtill the ſame, one of them came and at one blow diſpatched him with his Club. This is the uſage wherewith the <hi>Caribeans</hi> heretofore treated their Priſoners of War, but now they think it enough to put them to a ſpeedy death. As ſoon as this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Perſon is thus laid dead upon the place, the young men take the Body, and having waſhed it cut it in peices, and then boyl ſome part, and broil ſome upon wooden Frames made like a Gridiron for that purpoſe. When this deteſtable diſh is ready and ſeaſoned according to their Palates they divide it into ſo many parts as there are perſons preſent, and joyfully devour it, thinking that the World cannot afford any other repaſt equally delicious; The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lick the very ſticks whereon the fat dropped, not ſo much from the deliciouſneſs they find in that kind of ſuſtenance as from the exceſſive pleaſure they conceive in being revenged in that manner of their cheifeſt enemies, and to heighten this rage and hatred againſt the <hi>Arovages</hi> they ſave the fat that comes from it; and keep it carefully in little Gourds to pour ſome few drops thereof into their ſauces at their ſolemn entertainments, ſo to perpetuate as much as lies in their power, the motive of revenge.</p>

The Commodities this Iſland affords are <hi>Sugar, Jndico, Ginger</hi> and <hi>Tobacco.</hi> It abounds in tame Cattel, and all ſorts of Fiſh, among which the <hi>Shark-Fiſh</hi> deſerves remark; It is a kind of <hi>Sea-dog,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Wolf,</hi> the moſt devouring of all Fiſhes, &amp; the moſt greedy of mans fleſh &amp; therefore dangerous to thoſe that ſwim, he lives altogether by prey, and commonly follows ſhips to feed on the filth caſt out of them into the Sea; Theſe Monſters ſeem yellow in the Water, ſome of them of a vaſt length and bigneſs, inſomuch that they are able to cut a man in two at one bite; Their Skin ſo rough that files are made of it to poliſh Wood; Their heads are flat, and the opening of their mouth not juſt before the ſnout but under it, ſo that they are forced to turn their Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies almoſt upward when they ſeize their Prey; Their Teeth are very ſharp and broad jagged about like a Saw, of which ſome have three or four ranks in each Jaw-Bone, they lye within his gums, but ſufficiently appear when there is occaſion. Theſe cruel <hi>Sea-Dogs</hi>

are attended by two or three ſmall Fiſhes and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, which go before them with ſuch ſwiftneſs, and exactneſs that they either go forward or ſtay as he does; The Meat of him is not good, but the brains are counted uſeful againſt the ſtone and Gravel.</p>
               <p>Another Ravenous Sea-Monſter found on theſe Coaſts is called the <hi>Becune,</hi> a dreadful enemy to Mankind, in ſhape like a Pike but ſeven or eight foot long, he lives by prey, &amp; furiouſly faſtens like a bloud-hound on the men he perceives in the Water. He carries away whatever he once faſtens on, and his teeth are ſo venemous, that the leaſt touch of them becomes mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, if ſome Soveraign Antidote be not inſtantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to divert and abate the Poyſon. There are another kind of <hi>Becunes</hi> by ſome call <hi>Sea Wood-Cocks,</hi> their beaks being ſomewhat like a Wood-cocks bill only the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part is much longer than the lower, and it moves both Jaws with like facility; Some of them are four foot long and twelve Inches broad neer the head, which is ſomewhat like a Swines, with two large eyes extreamly Shining, he hath two Fins on the ſides and under the Belly a great plume riſing higher like a Cocks comb, reaching from head to Tail: Beſides the long ſolid beak, it hath two ſorts of Horns, hard, black, and about a foot and an half in length which hang down under his throat and are particular to this kind of fiſh, and theſe he can eaſily hide in a hollow place under his Belly which ſerves them for a Sheath, it hath no Scales but a rough black Skin on the back, and the meat is eatable. Another Fiſh found neer theſe Iſlands is called the <hi>Sea <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rchin</hi> or <hi>Hedghog,</hi> and well deſerves that name, it is round as a Ball and full of Sharp prickles for which it is feared, ſome call it the armed Fiſh, they are ſent as Preſents to the curious to hang in their cloſets.</p>
               <p>The Sea Parrots are likewiſe admirable which have beautiful ſparkling eyes the Balls cleer as Chryſtal, incloſed within a circle as green as an Emerald of which

colour are the Scales of their backs; They have no Teeth but Jaws above and below of a ſolid bone very ſtrong, of the ſame colour with their Scales and divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into little Compartiments very beautiful to the Eye, they live on ſhel fiſh, and with thoſe hard Jaw-bones they cruſh, as between two Milſtones, Oyſters, Muſcles and other ſhell fiſh to get out the meat. They are an excellent kind of Fiſh to eat, and ſo big that ſome of them have weighed above Twenty pound.

               <p>There is a fine Salt Pit in the Iſland, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is a Silver Mine, but becauſe the Salt Pits, Woods, Havens and Mines are common to both Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is not regarded, beſides the great ſtock, and multitude of ſlaves which ſuch an enterprize would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; The true Silver Mine is Sugar; This Iſland may be eaſily incompaſſed by Land, but one cannot paſs through the midſt of it, by reaſon of ſeveral great and ſteep Mountains, between which are dreadful Rocks, Precipices, and ſprings of hot Water, yea ſome ſprings of <hi>Sulphur</hi> which cauſeth one of them to be called the <hi>Sulphur Mountain;</hi> The Iſland ſeems to deſcend gently toward the Sea, and is divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſeveral Stages, from the uppermoſt whereof a man may take a very pleaſant Proſpect of all the Plantations from thence downward; There are many gallant Houſes built both by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi>

Monſieur <hi>Deſnambuck</hi> a <hi>French,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas Warner</hi> an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentleman jointly took poſſeſſion of St. <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> on the ſame day, in the names of the Kings of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> their Maſters, that they might have a place of ſafe retreat, and a good Haven for the Ships of both Nations bound for <hi>America,</hi> as being well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Proviſions, and therefore often viſited by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who ſometimes left the ſick there to be look'd to by the <hi>Caribeans</hi> with whom they had made a peace upon thoſe Terms.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Gentlemen having thus taken poſſeſſion of the Iſland, left ſome men therein to ſecure it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for the further eſtabliſhment of theſe Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to their reſpective Countreys; But before they parted hence, ſuſpecting ſome private Intelligence between the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> for deſtroying all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> in their abſence, they in one night rid their hands of the moſt factious of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſoon after forced all the reſt, who were got together in ſeveral Bodies and ſtood upon their Guard, to retire to ſome other Iſlands, and leave that to their diſpoſal. After this they both returned home, where their Conqueſts and Proceedings being approved of by the Kings their Maſters, they returned with recruits of men in the quality of Governors, and Lieutenants under the Kings of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided the Iſland according to their firſt Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> having plentiful Proviſions from <hi>London,</hi> proſpered much more than the <hi>French,</hi> who wanted neceſſary aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In 1629. a powerfull Fleet from <hi>Spain</hi> under <hi>Don Frederick de Toledo</hi> had received order from that King, that before he fell down to the <hi>Havana,</hi> he ſhould

Twenty thouſand Inhabitants beſides Negro Slaves who are thought a far greater number. In the reign of K. <hi>James</hi> the firſt a Ship of Sr. <hi>William Curteens</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from <hi>Fernambuck</hi> in <hi>Braſil,</hi> being driven by ſoul weather upon this Coaſt, chanced to fall upon this Iſland, and anchoring before it ſtaid ſome time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves of the nature thereof, which was ſo exceedingly over-grown with Woods that they could find no Champion or <hi>Savana's</hi> for men to dwell in, nor any Beaſts but a multitude of Swine, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> put aſhoar long before for breed, if they ſhould at any time be caſt on that ſhoar in foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the fruits and roots that grew there afforded ſo great plenty of food as they multiplied abundantly, ſo that the Natives of the other Iſlands uſe to come thither a hunting; This diſcovery being made, and advice given to their Friends in <hi>England,</hi> other Ships were ſent, and having cut down the Woods, and cleered the ground, they planted Potatoes, Plantines and Maiz, which with the Hogſfleſh they found ſerved only to keep Life and Soul together, and their ſupplies from <hi>England,</hi> coming ſo ſlow and uncertain, they were oft driven to great extremities, but in the year 1627. when they had more hands, and having <hi>Tobacco, Indico, Cotton Wool,</hi> and <hi>Fuſtick Wood</hi> to trade with, ſome Ships were invited with hope of gain to viſit them, bringing for exchange ſuch things as they wanted, as working Tools of Iron, and Steel, Cloaths, Shirts, Drawers, Hoſe, Shoes, Hats, and more Planters; So that in a ſhort time they grew very conſiderable, eſpecially when their Sugar Canes were grown, and they had learned the Art of making Sugar; The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants which conſiſt of <hi>Engliſh, Scotch, Iriſh,</hi> with ſome few <hi>Dutch, French</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> were lately calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to be above fifty Thouſand, and the Negro's about an hundred Thouſand; So that they can in a ſhort time arm Ten Thouſand fighting men, which with the natural advantage of the place, is able to defy the moſt potent Enemy, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ſound

to their coſt, having in vain aſſaulted it ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>It hath only one River or rather a Lake which runs not far into the Land, yet the Country lying low, and level they have divers Ponds, and are ſupplyed with Rain Water by making Ciſterns in their Houſes; The Air is very hot for eight months, and would be more inſupportable were it not for the cool breezes which riſe with the Sun, and blow ſtill freſher as that grows higher, but always from the Northeaſt except in the <hi>Turnado,</hi> and then it chop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about to the South an hour or two, and after returns as before, the other four months are not ſo hot, but like the air of <hi>England</hi> about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> and though they ſweat yet find not ſuch faintneſs as in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> neither are they thirſty unleſs overheated with labour or ſtrong drink. Their Bread is made of the root of a ſmall Tree or Shrub which they call <hi>Caſſavy,</hi> and account it wholſome and nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>They have a drink called <hi>Mobbie</hi> made of <hi>Potatoes;</hi> Another named <hi>Perino,</hi> which is reckoned much better though not altogether ſo pleaſant, made by the <hi>Indians</hi> for their own drinking of the <hi>Caſſavy</hi> Root, which of it ſelf is a ſtrong Poyſon, and this they cauſe their old Women whoſe Breath and Teeth have been tainted with many ſeveral Poxes, to chew and ſpit out into the Water, for the better breaking and macerating the Root, and in three or four hours this juice will work and purge it ſelf of the poyſonous quality, for the old Womens poyſnous Breath and the Poyſon of the <hi>Caſſavy</hi> being oppoſites, work with ſuch vehemency a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other as they ſpend their poyſonous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the conflict; They drink likewiſe <hi>Puncb, Plum drink, Plantane drink,</hi> A ſtrong drink made of the ſkimming of Sugar, Beveridge, and Wine of Pines, which is the beſt of all; Their Meat is generally Hogs Fleſh exceeding good, they feeding on nothing but Pompious as ſweet as Mellons, Plantanes, Sugar Canes and Maiz; They have alſo Turkies, Pullets, Muſcovy Ducks, Turtle Doves, Pidgeons and Rabbits; With
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57816:105"/>
excellent Fiſh, many kinds not known to us, as the green Turtle, who coming in with the Tyde, lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sands till the next return, and are eaſily taken in the <hi>Lucaick</hi> Iſlands, though not in this, but ſent hither; For it is but turning them on their Backs with ſtaves, and there they lye till they are fetcht away; A large Turtle (as we have mentioned) will have in her body half a Buſhel of Eggs which ſhe lays in the Sand, where they are hatcht by the Sun. When you are to kill one of theſe Fiſhes, you lay him on his Back on a Table, and when he ſees you come with a Knife in your hand to kill him, he ſends forth the moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſighs that ever were heard, and ſheds Tears in abundance, after he is opened, and his Heart taken out, if you lay it in a Diſh, it will ſtir and pant ten hours after the Fiſh is dead, there is no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate in taſt, nor more nouriſhing than he.</p>
               <p>This Iſland may be divided into Maſters, Servants and Slaves; The Maſters live in all affluence of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight, the Servants after five years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Freemen of the Iſland, and then imploy their time as may be moſt to their advantage; but the <hi>Negro</hi>-Slaves and their Children being in Bondage for ever, are preſerved with greater care; but uſed with ſuch ſeverity, as occaſioned a great Conſpiracy againſt their Maſters ſome years ſince, which was ſo cloſely carried as no diſcovery was made till the day before it was to be acted, and then one of them either failing of his courage, or out of love to his Maſter, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prevented it, for which many of them were put to death, as a terror to the reſt, who being ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous might prove dangerous, but that they are kept in ſuch ſtrict aw, and not ſuffered to touch or handle a Weapon, ſo that nothing is more terrible to them than Gunſhot; and beſides being of different Countreys, they ſpeak divers Languages, and do not underſtand one another; For in ſome of thoſe places in <hi>Africa,</hi> where petty Kingdoms are, they ſell their Subjects, and ſuch as they take in Battel, whom they make
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57816:106"/>
Slaves, yea ſome poor Men ſell their Servants, their Children, and ſometimes their Wives, for ſuch Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick as our Merchants bring them; When they are brought hither, the Planters buy them out of the Ship, where they find them ſtark naked, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived in any outward Infirmity, chuſing them as they do Horſes in a Market, the ſtrongeſt, youthfuleſt and moſt beautiful yield the greateſt price; Thirty Pound Sterling for a Man, and Twenty five for a Woman, is uſual; if they buy any that have no Wives, they will come to their Maſters and complain they cannot live without, and he provides them one by the next Ships; Religion they have none, yet ſeem to acknowledge a God, by looking up to Heaven for revenge when they are wronged; One Negro Woman being brought to Bed of two Children, her Husband provided a Cord to hang her as falſe to him, but the Overſeer prevented it, by telling him it was common with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Women, and they liked them the better, yet if he were reſolved to Hang her, he ſhould be Hanged himſelf by her, the fear of which hindred him.</p>
               <p>The chief Towns in this Iſle are St. <hi>Michaels</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called <hi>Bridge-Town, Little Briſtol,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> with other Pariſhes of leſs note, and ſeveral Bays on the Seacoaſts. The Goverment is by Laws agreeable to thoſe in <hi>England;</hi> For which they have Courts of Judicature, Juſtices of Peace, Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Church-wardens and the like. The Iſland is very ſtrong as well by nature as Art; It is divided into ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Precincts, wherein are fourteen Churches and Chappels, the whole ſo filled with Houſes that it may almoſt ſeem one Great Town. There is a Fiſh called a <hi>Rock-fiſh</hi> taken neer this Iſland, which is red, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with ſeveral other colours very delightful to the Eye; And a great Fly called by the <hi>Indians Cucuyos</hi> which gives ſuch a great light, in the night that it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Flying Torch</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> not only guiding the Traveller by ſhewing his way in the night, but with the aſſiſtance of this light a man may eaſily write and read

               <p>In 1655. <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> who then uſurpt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, having made Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon an Adventure againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a Fleet, and giving out that the Voyage would be very profitable, being deſigned to a place where there was much Gold and ſtore of riches, but conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſign to the very laſt; Hope of gain incouraged many of low fortunes to engage in this enterprize, ſo that the Fleet, was ſoon filled, which ſetting Sail, <hi>Dec.</hi> 28. <hi>Venables</hi> commanding the Land Forces, and <hi>Pen</hi> being General at Sea, they put in at <hi>Barbadoes Jan.</hi> 28.

                  <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but had ſuch cold reception that he quickly returned; In the mean time the Fleet ſteered its courſe from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> to <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> one of the richeſt Iſlands in <hi>America,</hi> which was much wondered at, ſince at that time no open Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility was declared againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> and though it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, That the conditions of Peace extended not beyond the line, yet the <hi>Spaniard</hi> lookt on it as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute breach; The beginning of this Enterprize met with a Remarkable check, for when General <hi>Venables</hi> might have landed very neer St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> the chief Town in the Iſle and deſerted by the Garriſon, yet ruled by ſtrange Counſels of his own, or as ſome ſay overuled by his Wife, he ſet his men aſhoar ten Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues Weſtward of it, whereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took Courage and betook themſelves again to the defence of St. <hi>Domingo.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> landing, and ſeeing no oppoſition thought themſelves ſafe, and Lords of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and were already ſharing the Golden Mines among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; When contrary to their expectation, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſed it to be proclaimed at the head of the Army, that none upon pain of Death ſhould Plunder any Gold, Plate or Jewels, or kill any Cattle; Which damping their Spirits and the exceſſive heat of the Climate weakning their Bodys, by that time they had marched a moſt tedious and diſconſolate March, through thick Woods, in deep ſcalding Sands, ready to periſh with miſerable drought and Thirſt for want of Water, of which they met not with a drop in many miles, they were brought into ſuch a Condition that they needed not an Enemy to kill them, being already almoſt dead with faintneſs and weakneſs, ſo that the <hi>Spaniards Negro's</hi> and <hi>Molatto's</hi> falling upon them, deſtroyed them without reſiſtance, till they were weary of killing, and thoſe thought themſelves happy, who
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57816:107"/>
could make their eſcape to their Ships. Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Hains</hi> and above ſix hundred others fell in this skirmiſh beſides near as many more in ſtragling Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all this Execution was done with the loſs of not above ſixty of the Enemy. The remnant of this Naval Army, that they might not be thought to have undertaken ſo long a Voyage, and of ſuch expectation in vain, poſſeſt themſelves with little or no oppoſition of the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which though not ſo plentiful and rich as the place they aimed at, yet with much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and the Supplies ſent them from <hi>England,</hi> they made it a tolerable Habitation to abide in, planting themſelves at <hi>Oriſtano</hi> the chief, and then only Town therein. In 1658. five hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> under <hi>Don Chriſtopher Arnaldo Saffer</hi> landed in this Iſland, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fortifie themſelves at a place called St. <hi>Ann,</hi> but were fiercely ſet upon by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and forced to fly into the Woods and Mountains; and another body of three hundred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having fortified themſelves at <hi>Chareras</hi> in the North of this Iſland, were by the then Governor Collonel <hi>Doyly</hi> driven quite out of their hold, <hi>Don Franciſco de Preucia,</hi> the <hi>Maeſtro del Campo</hi> with others taken, many killed, and the reſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſperſed.</p>
               <p>This grand diſaſter with many petty ill ſucceſſes cauſed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to diſpair of regaining the Iſland, and to Ship off moſt of their Plate and Women, and the <hi>Negro</hi>'s finding the greateſt part of their Maſters to be dead, killed the Governour, and decline all obedience to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> chuſing themſelves a Black for their Governour, and ſuch was the weakneſs of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that inſtead of correcting them they were forced to beg their aſſiſtance, which yet would not prevail, for ſoon after they ſubmitted to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and made Diſcoveries of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Negro</hi>'s that would not join with them; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next year the <hi>Spaniards</hi> quite deſerted the Iſland, except thirty or forty of their Slaves who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to the Mountains, but being afraid of a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57816:108"/>
diſcovery, and to be purſued to death for ſome Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by them committed, they built themſelves Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo's, and in them fled to <hi>Cuba,</hi> and never ſince had any conſiderable attempt made upon them. The <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> being thus become Maſters of the Iſland, formed themſelves into a Colony, and begun to ſettle Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, while others betook themſelves to Sea as Privateers, the better to ſecure themſelves againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and force them to a Peace by ſeizing their Ships, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were very ſucceſsful. This cauſed the Iſle to be much talked of and eſteemed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſent them ſupplies of Men, Proviſions and neceſſaries, and thus by degrees it became ſo potent as now it is; And though the ſucceſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at the beginning of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> War was but in-different, yet it afterward proved Fortunate enough by gaining ſeveral Victories, &amp; great prizes from them as our <hi>Engliſh Virgil</hi> then Sung.</p>
